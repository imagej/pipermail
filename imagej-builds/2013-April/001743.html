Changes:

[Stephan Preibisch] added complexconjugate as method

[Stephan Preibisch] FFTConvolution now works correctly. Thanks a lot for pointing out this long-standing bug

[Tobias Pietzsch] variants of positionToIndex and indexToPostion utility functions using

[Tobias Pietzsch] added RealTransforms implementing 2D polar transform.

[Tobias Pietzsch] added Views method to extend a RandomAccessibleInterval with zero.

[Stephan Preibisch] added public get methods for entries

[Johannes Schindelin] Upgrade to JFreechart 1.0.14

[Stephan Preibisch] fixed a small bug in the legacy imglib2 fft code found by Brian Northan ... thanks a lot!

[Stephan Preibisch] fixed long standing bug that prevents loading the new SPIM data

[Barry DeZonia] Improve speed of HyperVolumePointSetIterator

[Johannes Schindelin] This is the end of ImgLib1 as we know it

[Stephan Preibisch] enable the CellImg to provide access to the underlying data

[Johannes Schindelin] Set the top-level's groupId/version correctly
