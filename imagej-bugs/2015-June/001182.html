            Bug ID: 1100
           Summary: Coloc2 apparently no longer being supported
           Product: Fiji
           Version: unspecified
          Hardware: PC
                OS: Windows
            Status: NEW
          Severity: major
          Priority: P5
         Component: Plugins
          Assignee: <A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-bugs">imagej-bugs at imagej.net</A>
          Reporter: <A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-bugs">ann.wheeler at igmm.ed.ac.uk</A>

Dear Curtis et al.

I have now discovered that the person who was writing and supporting Coloc2 in
Fiji is no longer doing so. They have apparently left the MPI in Dresden and
are now working for a company.

This explains why the plugin has been broken for such a long time.

This is a major issue for those in the community who need colocalisation
analysis for their scientific research. Since the plugin is effectively half
finished and the writer of the plugin has little intention of completing the
work apparently. In fact they tried to sell me their companies products in
response to my query about Coloc2.

Likely the MPI-Dresden will be taken up coding plugins for SPIM, such as Big
data viewer and presumably wouldn't have personnel to finish the project.

Colocalisation was reliably and robustly implemented in IJ1 and needs must IJ2
/ FIJI should at least be able to reproduce the functionality available in IJ1
in newer versions. But what would happen in this circumstance, when the person
tasked with reimplementing the plugin gives up half way through? Clearly the
job needs to be completed. I can see if my image informaticist might be
interested as a last recourse. I don't program Java and have no time to learn
so can't offer to help personally, I have discussed this at ELMI with the
bioimage community so I am aware its a known issue.
