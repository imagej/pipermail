Hi Deepika

Thank you I received the file and could play with it.

There is a major misunderstanding here, and it is caused by outdated
documentation. 

Indeed, the threshold you set in the LoG detector panel is NOT a threshold on
spot maximal intensity, but on spot QUALITY. The spot quality is a value
generated by detectors that has no direct link with maximal intensity. It
simple reflects how certain is the detector that the spot it finds is a good
one. 

However, I read the documentation again, and it states that the threshold
indeed acts on maximal intensity, which is wrong. See 
<A HREF="http://fiji.sc/Getting_started_with_TrackMate">http://fiji.sc/Getting_started_with_TrackMate</A>

I will fix this. 

Now if you want to filter spot on maximal intensity, you have to use a filter
on this value in the spot filter panel.

Thank you very much.
