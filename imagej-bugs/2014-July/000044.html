--- Comment #2 from Johannes Schindelin &lt;<A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-bugs">johannes.schindelin at gmx.de</A>&gt; ---
Whoops, mid-air collision! However, I still would like to provide my input:

First of all, thank you for the bug report. As you well know, the ImageJ/Fiji
projects only work because of the collaborative spirit of the ImageJ community.

Now some background: in ImageJ 1.x, there is not really any good extension
mechanism for file input/output. Sure, there are some plugins implementing
readers and writers, although they frequently miss metadata due to the utterly
free nature of plugins that provide little guiding for implementers.

The first attempt at an extension mechanism was made by Greg Jefferis who
implemented the method where you can provide a plugin class called
`HandleExtraFileTypes` that ImageJ 1.x looks for if it does not know about a
certain file type, letting that (meta) plugin handle the file loading.

However, the `HandleExtraFileTypes` approach has three obvious shortcomings:

- just like with Highlander, there can be only one. Two independent projects
cannot extend the file input/output independently: if users install two .jar
files containing a `HandleExtraFileTypes` class each, only one will win. The
other will be ignored. We had a lot of fun with that in Fiji.

- since `HandleExtraFileTypes` is a meta plugin, handing off based on some
indicators inferred from the file name and/or the first 1024 bytes, it inherits
all the problems about lacking metadata (or even worse, metadata provided in
incompatible ways by different reader plugins).

- some file types cannot be handled by `HandleExtraFileTypes` because ImageJ
1.x thinks it knows them. The most prominent example is certainly the OME-TIFF:
it has the file extension .ome.tiff, but ImageJ 1.x misinterprets the .tiff
extension to mean that its internal `TiffDecoder` class -- which does not know
the first thing about OME-TIFFs of course, missing all the metadata. Of course,
the OME-TIFF issue could be worked around in ImageJ 1.x by special-casing
.ome.tiff, but that would just paper over the fundamental issue that ImageJ 1.x
simply cannot be extended in a way overriding its internal readers and writers.

The last point also illuminates another crucial point about the ImageJ 1.x file
input/output handling: the *core* readers/writers of ImageJ 1.x do not use the
same mechanism as third-party readers/writers have to use, thereby making
things inconsistent.

To address this issue, the architecture of ImageJ2 demanded a switch to
consistent, powerful file input/output plugins, using the very same mechanism
for *all* file input/output, including for the default readers/writers. The
default readers/writers can also be overridden by implementing plugins with a
higher priority.

Now, the ImageJ2 project has a long term vision -- which makes things a little
more complicated in the short run, but ultimately infinitely more robust even
in the intermediate future. For example, the plugin framework has been made
modular -- recognizing the fact that it is not specific to image processing at
all -- and put into its own component: scijava-common.

Likewise, the file input/output does not need to be specific to ImageJ now,
does it? That is why it lives in its own component, SCIFIO. The benefit should
be quite obvious when you look how widely usable SCIFIO is even *outside*
ImageJ: ITK, for example, a very powerful (and complex) C++ library, uses
SCIFIO to support hundreds of file types.

Back to your concrete report, I see that you actually have *two* issues, one of
which needs feedback.

1) there is a memory leak. Actually, I do not really know about that because
you use the task manager which is notoriously unreliable to assess memory usage
by Java virtual machines (due to the specifics of JVM memory management). We
will have to invest some time here to figure out whether it is a *real* or an
*unreal* issue: if the JVM deallocates memory only reluctantly, for performance
reasons, you would see the symptoms you described, but it would actually *not*
be a problem.

2) the slowness of SCIFIO. Since SCIFIO -- like `HandleExtraFileTypes` --
relies on format-specific plugins, it is not enough to report that it is slow.
You will need to provide us with an example image (the smaller the example
image is without sacrificing the slowness symptom, the better): just upload it
with Help&gt;Upload Sample Image and leave a note in this bug report.

As to 2) a word of caution: we often see that users compare in particular the
performance of SCIFIO's Tiff reader with ImageJ 1.x' TiffDecoder, not knowing
that the latter takes a couple of shortcuts that actually violate the Tiff
standard. In other words, we try to make SCIFIO's readers *robust* and
*correct* at the moment and hope to soon enter the phase where we also make
them *fast*.
