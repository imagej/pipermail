--- Comment #3 from Johannes Schindelin &lt;<A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-bugs">johannes.schindelin at gmx.de</A>&gt; ---
&gt;<i> Is there any particular reason why this option should not be available any longer?
</I>
Yes. The way export .jar was implemented for scripts was tied very tightly to
the Fiji scripting framework.

Now, the Fiji scripting framework was quite useful as a proof of concept for
the SciJava scripting framework. It needed to be replaced by the latter,
though, because we essentially were completely unable to enhance the former to
our current needs, exemplified by the painful absence of R and Matlab bindings,
something some collaborators of mine actually needed for *years*.

So there were pressing needs that demanded a better way to do things, which we
now have: SciJava scripting.

&gt;<i> Why removing if it works fine?
</I>
It does not. It may work fine for your particular use case, but other
researchers were limited too much.

And we have a powerful replacement: storing the scripts directly into
plugins/Scripts/&lt;menu-path&gt;. This is not only much easier to understand, it
also makes it much easier to collaborate on scripts, another good reason
(demanded by collaborators of mine) why to abandon script-only .jar files.

Even better: this powerful replacement is part of ImageJ2, i.e. reaching more
users than just Fiji users.

The original reason to make the (Fiji-only) hack was to allow installing
scripts into arbitrary menus. Doing it via .jar files (the extension means
&quot;Java ARchive&quot;) worked, but it was papering over the real issue: we had to jump
through hoops, calling a plugin that was not even included in the .jar file
(and therefore might not even be present!) in order to execute a script.

We bought other problems by using this workaround, too: you could not use a
common library of script functions because the script had no way to pull the
library out of the same .jar file (because it was not there! And even if it
was, the script had no idea how it was read and from where, making it
impossible to discover library files in the same .jar file).

Now that we have a correct solution, i.e. a clean and simple way to install
scripts and macros into arbitrary menus, there is no need for an ugly hack,
even if it kinda worked for a long time.

Did that answer your questions?
