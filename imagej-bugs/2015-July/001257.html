--- Comment #3 from Timothy Grocott &lt;<A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-bugs">grocott.timothy at gmail.com</A>&gt; ---
*** Something weird with JAVA_HOME ***

The suggested workaround was to uninstall Java 8 and use use Java 6 instead. I
do not have Java 8 installed on my system (still running Mavericks so haven't
needed to), but apparently there is a cryptic/hidden version of Java 7...

I noticed that under &quot;Information about your version of Java:&quot; it says that I
am using Java 7 (1.7.0_55), yet when I run &quot;java -version&quot; from the terminal it
says I am running Java 6 (1.6.0_55).

The folder &quot;/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines&quot; is empty.

The Folder &quot;/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines&quot; contains a copy of
&quot;jdk1.6.0.jdk&quot; only, no other versions are present in this folder.

&gt;<i>From my bug report, under &quot;Information about your version of Java:&quot; Fiji
</I>reports that &quot;JAVA_HOME is set to: /Library/Internet
Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/&quot;.

According to OS X, JAVA_HOME is set to
&quot;/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home&quot;

Why would Fiji be pointing to a different version of Java (Java 7) hidden
inside an &quot;internet plug-in&quot;, when the according to OS X I am running Java 6?
Is this normal? If not, how can I fix it? I just removed and re-installed Fiji
in case something got corrupted, but it still reports Java 7, and JAVA_HOME
still points to that same &quot;internet plug-in&quot;.

&gt;<i>From examining other user's bug reports, their Fiji reports that JAVA_HOME is
</I>set to a sub-folder of &quot;/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines&quot;.

There seems to be some dis-connect between Fiji and OS X regarding what version
of Java I am using.

I tried forcing Fiji to use Java 6 via &quot;--java-home&quot; but Fiji failed to launch
citing a missing library.

I guess my next move is to try reinstalling Java 6 (and then Fiji, in that
order?) to see if that fixes Fiji's JAVA_HOME pointer. I don't know if it is
safe to remove the offending &quot;internet plug-in&quot;.

PS - I am using Netbeans to develop plugins. Could installing Netbeans have
interfered with JAVE_HOME?

PPS - I don't know anything about internet plug-ins, but I'm using Google
Chrome as a browser.

PPPS - I am trying to publish a Fiji plugin that requires a working version of
3D Viewer and am a little concerned about this problem arising during peer
review.
