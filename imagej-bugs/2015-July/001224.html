--- Comment #10 from Greg Von Kuster &lt;<A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-bugs">ghv2 at psu.edu</A>&gt; ---
Hi Curtis,

(In reply to Curtis Rueden from comment #8)
&gt;<i> Thanks Greg. To be clear, the continuous release of Fiji is not a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;development build&quot; -- each update is a reproducible version (i.e., all
</I>&gt;<i> release versions of JAR files) built from Fiji's master branch.
</I>
Thanks for the clarification on this, but when building tools for Galaxy, we
build them in such a way that all dependencies come with the tool when it is
installed from the Galaxy tool shed (<A HREF="https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu">https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu</A>) into a
Galaxy instance.  The Galaxy wrappers for the Imagej2 tools I'm building define
a dependency on the Fiji package using an installation recipe within an xml
file.  This xml file has a tag set that looks l-soemthing like this:

<A HREF="http://fiji.sc/downloads/Life-Line/fiji-linux64-20141125.tar.gz">http://fiji.sc/downloads/Life-Line/fiji-linux64-20141125.tar.gz</A>

This URL always guarantees that specific build of Fiji, so if the Galaxy
administrator uninstalls a tool and its required Fiji package from their Galaxy
instance, they are guaranteed to get the exact same version of the required
Fiji package when they re-install the tool.

Using the latest stable build URL will not guarantee this behavior.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The ImageJ2 development build is _not_ reproducible, but I think the
</I>&gt;<i> Downloads page is pretty clear about that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The main problem with the Fiji continuous releases is that they are not
</I>&gt;<i> currently archived anywhere and you can't downgrade. So to actually roll
</I>&gt;<i> back you'd need to know which commit hash you were on and rebuild Fiji using
</I>&gt;<i> Maven. Someday we hope to have a rollback feature, but it's probably not
</I>&gt;<i> going to happen this year.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for when we do another Life-Line version: we try to do one just before
</I>&gt;<i> making disruptive changes. The next disruptive change will certainly be the
</I>&gt;<i> switch over to Java 8 with a new deployment scheme that retires the ImageJ
</I>&gt;<i> Launcher. We hope to roll that out before September.
</I>
This is really good to know - it helps clarify some of my upcoming development
plans.

I have tried using the latest stable release of Fiji for these plugins that
I've found that do not produce output images that I expect, and it has made no
difference.

I've also looked into using xvfb to see if it will work for what I'm doing, but
I've discovered it really won't.  So I guess I just won't be able to wrap some
of the plugins into Galaxy tools.  This is unfortunate, but understandable. 
There are still very many useful ImageJ tools that I can wrap.

I have not yet figured out an easy way to determine if a plugin command will
run successfully from the command line without getting pretty far down the
&quot;finished wrapper&quot; path so that it can be tested.  If you have any ideas about
this, I would greatly appreciate them.

I appreciate all of your help on this ticket - you can close it when
convenient.   Please let me know if there is something else I should do
regarding its status.

Thanks again!

Greg Von Kuster
