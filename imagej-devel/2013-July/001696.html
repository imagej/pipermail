<PRE>Thanks for answering Aivar,

I think what your reply did for me is to have me take a step back and
consider what we're modeling. If you look at my replies below, I think that
the best solution is to use a model where the background is white and each
successive layer filters out some of that background, like a gel. A layer
attenuates the underlying layer by a fraction of (1 - alpha/255 * (1 -
red/255)), resulting in no attenuation for 255 and attenuation of alpha/255
for zero. We can then use a red converter that returns a value of 255 for
the blue and green channels and the model and math work correctly.

</I>&gt;<i> alphas might make sense here, because I think they should all be the same
</I>&gt;<i> value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think you're right, the model always is that each pixel has an alpha
value that applies to R, G and B. The image I was using was the Clown
example image. DefaultDatasetView.initializeView constructs three
RealLUTConverters for the projector, one for red, one for green and one for
blue which sends you down this rabbit hole.

&gt;<i> In addition, there's no scaling of the individual red, green and blue
</I>&gt;<i> values by their channel's alpha. If the input were two index-color images,
</I>&gt;<i> each of which had different alphas, the code should multiply the r, g and b
</I>&gt;<i> values by the alphas before summing and then divide by the total alpha in
</I>&gt;<i> the end. The alpha in this case *should* be the sum of alphas divided by
</I>&gt;<i> the number of channels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think alpha processing is more cumulative, done layer by layer in some
</I>&gt;<i> defined layer order.  For a given pixel say the current output pixel value
</I>&gt;<i> is ARGB1 and you are compositing a second image with value ARGB2 on top of
</I>&gt;<i> it:  For the red channel the output color should be ((255 - alpha(ARGB2)) *
</I>&gt;<i> red(ARGB1) + alpha(ARGB2) * red(ARGB2)) / 255.  The alpha of ARGB1 is not
</I>&gt;<i> involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think that's a valid interpretation. I've always used (alpha(ARGB1) *
red(ARGB1) + alpha(ARGB2) * red(ARGB2)) / (alpha(ARGB1) + alpha(ARGB2))
because I assumed the alpha indicated the
strength of the blending of each source. In any case, the code as it stands
doesn't do either of these.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, if you add a layer that is completely opaque you no longer
</I>&gt;<i> have to consider any of the colors or alpha values underneath it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> I think the bigger issue here is this code is specifically designed to
</I>&gt;<i> composite red, green and blue image layers.  It's a special case since for
</I>&gt;<i> a given pixel the red comes from the red layer, blue from blue layer, and
</I>&gt;<i> green from green layer.  These layers shouldn't be completely opaque, since
</I>&gt;<i> the colors wouldn't combine at all then or completely transparent since
</I>&gt;<i> then they wouldn't contribute any color.  I don't think transparency is
</I>&gt;<i> useful here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>So this is an argument for blending instead of layering - transparency
would be useful if the images were blended and treated as if on a par with
each other, allowing the user to emphasize one channel or the other.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's also possible that a multichannel image with &gt; 3 channels is being
</I>&gt;<i> displayed with more color channels, namely cyan, magenta, and yellow.  The
</I>&gt;<i> code here is designed to stop overflow, but I'm not convinced those
</I>&gt;<i> extended color channels would combine meaningfully.

</I>&gt;<i> values by their channel's alpha. If the input were two index-color images,

</I>&gt;<i> the number of channels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think alpha processing is cumulative layer by layer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This brings up some interesting questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) If the first, bottom-most layer is transparent, what color should show
</I>&gt;<i> through?  Black, white?  Or perhaps it's best to ignore this base layer
</I>&gt;<i> transparency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Maybe the model should be that the background is white and successive
layers are like gel filters on top. In that case, you'd have:
red = (255 - alpha(ARGB2) *(255 - red(ARGB2))/255) * red(ARGB1)

And maybe that points to what the true solution is. For the default, we
could change things so that red channel would have blue = 255 and green =
255 and the first composition would change only the red channel.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) If you wanted to composite several transparent images, how do you
</I>&gt;<i> calculate the transparency of the composite?  I'm not sure this is
</I>&gt;<i> something we need to do.

</I>&gt;<i>  targetCursor.get().set( ARGBType.rgba( rSum, gSum, bSum, aSum ) );
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  However, I think the problem is deeper than that. For an RGB ImgPlus,
</I>&gt;<i> there are three LUTs and each of them has an alpha of 255, but that alpha
</I>&gt;<i> only applies to one of the colors in the LUT. When you're compositing

</I>&gt;<i> the result is 1/3 of the white intensity - if you translate that to red,
</I>&gt;<i> green and blue images, the resulting intensity will be 1/3 of that desired.
</I>&gt;<i> This might sound weird, but the only solution that works out mathematically
</I>&gt;<i> is for the defaultLUTs in the DefaultDatasetView to use color tables that
</I>&gt;<i> return values that are 3x those of ColorTables.RED, GREEN and BLUE.
</I>&gt;<i> Thinking about it, I'm afraid this *is* the correct model and each channel
</I>&gt;<i> really is 3x brighter than possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  It took me quite a bit of back and forth to come up with the above... I
</I>&gt;<i> hope you all understand what I'm saying and understand the problem and
</I>&gt;<i> counter-intuitive solution and have the patience to follow it. Dscho, if
