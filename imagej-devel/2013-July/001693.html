<PRE>&gt;<i> I have an ImgPlus backed by an RGB PlanarImg of UnsignedByteType and 
</I>&gt;<i> ARGBType.alpha(value) is 255 for all of them, so aSum is 765. It would 
</I>&gt;<i> appear that the correct solution would be to divide aSum by 3.
</I>Isn't it unusual to define an alpha for each color component, generally 
you have a single A associated with a combined RGB?  So averaging the 
three alphas might make sense here, because I think they should all be 
the same value.
&gt;<i> In addition, there's no scaling of the individual red, green and blue 
</I>&gt;<i> values by their channel's alpha. If the input were two index-color 
</I>&gt;<i> images, each of which had different alphas, the code should multiply 
</I>&gt;<i> the r, g and b values by the alphas before summing and then divide by 
</I>&gt;<i> the total alpha in the end. The alpha in this case *should* be the sum 
</I>&gt;<i> of alphas divided by the number of channels.
</I>I think alpha processing is more cumulative, done layer by layer in some 
defined layer order.  For a given pixel say the current output pixel 
value is ARGB1 and you are compositing a second image with value ARGB2 
on top of it:  For the red channel the output color should be ((255 - 
alpha(ARGB2)) * red(ARGB1) + alpha(ARGB2) * red(ARGB2)) / 255.  The 
alpha of ARGB1 is not involved.

In other words, if you add a layer that is completely opaque you no 
longer have to consider any of the colors or alpha values underneath it.


I think the bigger issue here is this code is specifically designed to 
composite red, green and blue image layers.  It's a special case since 
for a given pixel the red comes from the red layer, blue from blue 
layer, and green from green layer.  These layers shouldn't be completely 
opaque, since the colors wouldn't combine at all then or completely 
transparent since then they wouldn't contribute any color.  I don't 
think transparency is useful here.

It's also possible that a multichannel image with &gt; 3 channels is being 
displayed with more color channels, namely cyan, magenta, and yellow.  
The code here is designed to stop overflow, but I'm not convinced those 
extended color channels would combine meaningfully.

</I>I think alpha processing is cumulative layer by layer.

This brings up some interesting questions:

1) If the first, bottom-most layer is transparent, what color should 
show through?  Black, white?  Or perhaps it's best to ignore this base 
layer transparency.

2) If you wanted to composite several transparent images, how do you 
calculate the transparency of the composite?  I'm not sure this is 
something we need to do.

</I>&gt;<i> bSum = 255;
</I>&gt;<i> targetCursor.get().set( ARGBType.rgba( rSum, gSum, bSum, aSum ) );
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think the problem is deeper than that. For an RGB ImgPlus, 
</I>&gt;<i> there are three LUTs and each of them has an alpha of 255, but that 
</I>&gt;<i> alpha only applies to one of the colors in the LUT. When you're 
</I>&gt;<i> compositing images and weighing them equally, if two are black and one 
</I>&gt;<i> is white, then the result is 1/3 of the white intensity - if you 
</I>&gt;<i> translate that to red, green and blue images, the resulting intensity 
</I>&gt;<i> will be 1/3 of that desired. This might sound weird, but the only 
</I>&gt;<i> solution that works out mathematically is for the defaultLUTs in the 
</I>&gt;<i> DefaultDatasetView to use color tables that return values that are 3x 
</I>&gt;<i> those of ColorTables.RED, GREEN and BLUE. Thinking about it, I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> afraid this *is* the correct model and each channel really is 3x 
</I>&gt;<i> brighter than possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It took me quite a bit of back and forth to come up with the above... 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you all understand what I'm saying and understand the problem 
</I>&gt;<i> and counter-intuitive solution and have the patience to follow it. 
</I>&gt;<i> Dscho, if you made it this far - you're the mathematician, what's your 
</I>&gt;<i> take?
