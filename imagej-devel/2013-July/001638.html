<PRE>Dear Curtis and Johannes,

I have studied all the lessons suggested below and taken them as far as I could go with them.  For example, in Working with repositories example, I can fork the Spoon-Knife project to my account, but I cannot clone it, because there is no &quot;Clone on Mac&quot; button anywhere on the page.  There is a &quot;Clone in Desktop&quot; button, but that just takes me to the mac.github.com page for downloading GitHub for Mac, which I already have.  So I cannot do the clone and therefore I cannot go any further with the tutorial.  I can and have read the tutorials beyond, but I cannot do any of the examples beyond the cloning part.

As a result, I am unable to work with my project.  I have the errors that package org.jdesktop.layout does not exist, although I suspect swing-layout-1.0.4 (which contains org.jdesktop.layout) does exist because the project ran before I removed the APC_ dependency in my pom.  

I would love to be able to clone my project and resolve the errors, but the tutorials do not match what I see in my github page, and I don't have enough information to know why and resolve these issues. 

Chris

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You already have the clone on your workstation. You wouldn't have been

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> workstation is where you created it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK, but I created the README on the website
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards">https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards</A>), not with a terminal command.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, that was not exactly what that page said, was it? It can be fixed,
</I>&gt;<i> but it requires more effort on your side than if you had not created the
</I>&gt;<i> files on the website.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I then went through the instructions and tried to create the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello-World README from the terminal, that's when I got the errors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Multiple errors, because you had to understand the commands listed in the
</I>&gt;<i> article in order to adapt them to your particular case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For one, your repository is not called Hello-World.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another problem is that you did not know how to undo an already-run
</I>&gt;<i> command (git remote add ...).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I click the &quot;clone in desktop&quot; button on the github.com site, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> takes me to the <A HREF="http://mac.github.com/">http://mac.github.com/</A> site where my only option is to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> download Git for Mac -- which I already downloaded.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... and which you could use as described on
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-repositories#cloning">https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-repositories#cloning</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> to clone your own GitHub repository.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Step (D) is &quot;git commit&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> GitHub for Mac can help you do that, if you study the information conveyed in
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="https://help.github.com/articles/making-changes">https://help.github.com/articles/making-changes</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Step (E) is &quot;git push&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This page has the information which you need to learn in order to use
</I>&gt;<i> GitHub for Mac to &quot;push&quot; (which they call synchronize because it is more
</I>&gt;<i> convenient than the &quot;push&quot; concept of Git what they do: they have a
</I>&gt;<i> two-way synchronisation between the remote repository and the local one).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="https://help.github.com/articles/making-changes#sync-your-changes-with-github">https://help.github.com/articles/making-changes#sync-your-changes-with-github</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The book and other Git tutorials have more information.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You are already really close -- you have the code on your local
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> workstation, you have a GitHub repository already in existence, you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have a local Git repository linked to that remote repository, so all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you have to do is commit and push.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The errors you mentioned yesterday were because your local Git
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> repository had the wrong URL for the GitHub remote. That's why I asked
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you to check the output of &quot;git remote -v&quot;. It should say your origin
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is &quot;<A HREF="https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards">https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards</A>&quot;. If it says &quot;Hello-World&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that is wrong. To fix, try this:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> git remote rm origin
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> git remote add origin <A HREF="https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards">https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course it is best if you understand that these commands work *inside*
</I>&gt;<i> one working directory that has remote information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is the result of those commands in my terminal:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ChrisGAIAG:~ chris$ git remote rm origin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, what do you expect if you remove the 'origin' remote in your home
</I>&gt;<i> directory, which is not the working directory of the repository you
</I>&gt;<i> initialized with &quot;git init&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I told you in an earlier mail that each local repository lives in a .git/
</I>&gt;<i> subdirectory of the working directory. You created a Hello-World directory
</I>&gt;<i> and made it the working directory of a newly-initialized repository by
</I>&gt;<i> calling
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	git init
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *inside* Hello-World/. So that is where your Git information is: in
</I>&gt;<i> Hello-World/.git/.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Git will not try to guess what you mean if you are outside that directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ChrisGAIAG:~ chris$ git remote add origin <A HREF="https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards">https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In general, it is a real bad idea to call the second command in any set of
</I>&gt;<i> instructions when the first one failed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So do I need to cd to some place first?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, yes. As described above, Git has no chance of knowing what
</I>&gt;<i> project you want it to work on if you are outside the project's working
</I>&gt;<i> directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is even what Git said:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which is true, because I am sure that there does not exist a .git/
</I>&gt;<i> directory in your home directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Or, as Johannes says: just reclone from your GitHub remote into a new
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> directory, and then copy your files into there, and then commit and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> push using the GitHub for Mac GUI.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Don't worry about &quot;screwing anything up&quot; because you can always just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> delete and recreate the repository. It's not like you're going to lose
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hundreds of hours of work, here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The GitHub for Mac is a complete mystery right now.  There is a long
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list of my java classes and resources, followed at the end with a link
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to my NetBeans project folder, so I see there is a link to my computer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess I am in fact close.  I just need to figure out how to commit and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> push.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I think that understanding the information given in
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="https://help.github.com/articles/making-changes">https://help.github.com/articles/making-changes</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> should help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And of course, resolve the strange errors in my project that can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recognize the Swing components of my jFrames when I removed the APC_
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> class from my pom dependencies.  Now when I attempt to run it on my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> computer, I get this error:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/jdesktop/layout/GroupLayout$Group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	at A_Postcard.run(A_Postcard.java:25)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	at A_Postcard.main(A_Postcard.java:35)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.jdesktop.layout.GroupLayout$Group
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, that is a new piece of information. I was left under the impression
</I>&gt;<i> that you built and ran the project inside NetBeans. Apparently not so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, when I was able to run my project, I get an error that it could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not find the class &quot;Versatile Wand&quot; which is in my project's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target&gt;classes.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So you *were* able to run your project in the meantime? I am sorry, but it
</I>&gt;<i> seems that I get incomplete information about the problems and the
</I>&gt;<i> progress on this side.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I fear that really, the only way forward that guarantees an efficient use
</I>&gt;<i> of your, Curtis' and my time, is to get familiar enough with Git or GitHub
</I>&gt;<i> for Mac so that you can publish exactly the files with which you have a
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is my failing that I do not understand from the descriptions what the
</I>&gt;<i> exact invocations and the exact error messages are, and therefore trying
</I>&gt;<i> to help you would only result in super-wild guesses that are unlikely to
</I>&gt;<i> assist you in fixing the issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only way I could help effectively would be to be able to get at
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the same state where you are at, to be able to try to reproduce
</I>&gt;<i> your problem, and to fix it by way of a pull request (no need to fear, the
</I>&gt;<i> GitHub notification you receive will have detailed information that, when
</I>&gt;<i> read carefully, will equip you with everything you need to get back my
</I>&gt;<i> changes).
