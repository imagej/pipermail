</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> | The &quot;Clone in Mac&quot; button requires that you be logged into GitHub.com

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes!  That was the missing link that I never saw in all my github and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> git for mac reading.  Thank you!  :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmpf. I am pretty sad that my detailed mails (that took quite some time to
</I>&gt;<i> write, I might add) did not manage to tell you that information. In
</I>&gt;<i> particular the part
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	I just downloaded the application, started it, and input my
</I>&gt;<i> 	credentials in the dialog asking for my GitHub login.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> of <A HREF="http://imagej.net/pipermail/imagej-devel/2013-July/001643.html">http://imagej.net/pipermail/imagej-devel/2013-July/001643.html</A> should
</I>&gt;<i> have given you that clue.
</I>
I am so sorry you feel I have been superficial in my study of your help.  I assure you I studied everything carefully and thoroughly.  My problem was I couldn't make things happen as they were supposed to in the tutorials and your instructions, but now in retrospect, I see that I was not getting certain points, the most critical was that i had to log into my account before trying to clone.  I never saw that instruction anywhere, but that was the critical point.  The rest was very clear and thorough.  I appreciated the amount of writing and careful work you put into the answer the moment I opened the email.  Thank you so much!  

&gt;&gt;<i> Now, before I make a mess of my Netbeans project on my computer, where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should I clone my project?  I have a Postcards file in my NetBeans
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project forlder:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So my question is, should I navigate to the A_Postcard folder:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or the Postcards folder:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Postcards on my github.com/ad1054/Postcards does not have the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nbactions.xml or the target folder, so will I be messing up my NetBeans
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project if I clone it there?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since all of those are failed, earlier attempts, why not follow my
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion (that I even repeated a couple of times now) to throw them away
</I>&gt;<i> and start over until you understand what you are doing there?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After all, it takes a substantial amount of knowledge of Git to reproduce
</I>&gt;<i> where you went wrong and what things are in your working directories and
</I>&gt;<i> repositories, and what is missing. And then it would take even more amount
</I>&gt;<i> of Git-fu to repair it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, it is really asking Adrian a lot to guess what the different
</I>&gt;<i> folders you have on your computer reflect. They could be anything, from
</I>&gt;<i> locally-initialized to forked to renamed folders, even empty folders,
</I>&gt;<i> folders that were originally named 'a-little-mouse', and nothing you
</I>&gt;<i> explained or showed could clarify that question.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So again: if you failed to accomplish what you wanted to do, throw it away
</I>&gt;<i> and start over. Until you understand why Git, or GitHub, or GitHub for
</I>&gt;<i> Mac, or Netbeans, or Maven did what they did.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ciao,
</I>&gt;<i> Johannes
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S.: you still have not had a look at my fix, did you?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.P.S.: there are so many ways to extract code from GitHub, e.g. the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Download ZIP&quot; button on <A HREF="https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards/">https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards/</A> (but beware:
</I>&gt;<i> they might rename it to &quot;Download&quot; and ask you to specify which format you
</I>&gt;<i> want in the future, &quot;Download ZIP&quot; is not guaranteed to be the label for
</I>&gt;<i> all future!). Even if a clone would fail, you still would have a ton of
</I>&gt;<i> ways to find out what changes others made.
</I>
Again, thank you.  I am going to restart and this time I expect I can do it without all the pleas for help.  :-)
