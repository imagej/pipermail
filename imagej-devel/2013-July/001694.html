<PRE>Hi Michael, Christian, Martin,

&gt;<i> I just worked through the &quot;code question&quot; (version, context, ...)
</I>&gt;<i> everything  seems to work again.
</I>
Excellent, glad to hear!

&gt;<i> Without a (hacky) checkbox we would end up with simply not calling
</I>&gt;<i> preview() on Previewable commands. Additionally we could also change
</I>&gt;<i> this if we wanted to support previews in the future.
</I>
I filed a ticket to remove all &quot;Preview&quot; checkbox parameters:
    <A HREF="http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1952">http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1952</A>

&gt;<i> @dynamic command detection =&gt; ticket filed
</I>
Thanks, Michael! For lurkers, the ticket is:
    <A HREF="http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1933">http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1933</A>

&gt;<i> We would definitly provide our help for the creation of such a list
</I>&gt;<i> (at least we could look through the plugins and mark the ones that are
</I>&gt;<i> useful within KNIME) however it might be better to delay this until
</I>&gt;<i> short before the final release (final set of plugins, stable plugin
</I>&gt;<i> system).
</I>
Great. I filed a ticket for it, slated for 2.0.0 final release:
    <A HREF="http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1953">http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1953</A>

&gt;<i> @service order  =&gt; ticket filed
</I>
Thanks! That ticket is at:
    <A HREF="http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1934">http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1934</A>

And I already fixed it. ;-)

&gt;<i> @dimension selection as discussed between christian and curtis we will
</I>&gt;<i> open a ticket with a better explenation for this issue
</I>
Christian did file a ticket for it, which is at:
    <A HREF="http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1944">http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1944</A>

It's a doozy, so I classified it as a &quot;feature&quot; and tentatively slated for
2.0.0 final release. We will need it for ImageJ2 to really behave
compatibly with ImageJ1's slice-wise PluginFilters. But it will be a
significant undertaking requiring some thought to get both the API and UI
right.

Thanks again for all the feedback and hard work, guys.

Regards,
Curtis

&gt;<i>  Hi Curtis,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for the reply, I just worked through the &quot;code question&quot; (version,
</I>&gt;<i> context, ...) everything  seems to work again.
</I>&gt;<i> Now for the other issues
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @preview checkboxes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Michael wrote:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Would it be possible to add a flag that surpresses previews checkboxes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; during dialog building?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  It's tricky because right now, each preview checkbox is an input
</I>&gt;<i> parameter to the command itself. But personally I don't like that approach.
</I>&gt;<i> It is not a &quot;real&quot; input to the command, but rather intended to be toggled
</I>&gt;<i> during input harvesting only. One option might be to label the visibility
</I>&gt;<i> of those parameters as ItemVisibility.INVISIBLE. Then we could add a flag
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere to hide INVISIBLE parameters, maybe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  But really, I am leaning toward a simpler solution: just remove the
</I>&gt;<i> preview checkboxes, in favor of ImageJ2 *always* doing a preview (and of
</I>&gt;<i> course, KNIP doesn't have to). And if the previews are too slow, we can
</I>&gt;<i> optimize the preview() method to address it, rather than having this hacky
</I>&gt;<i> checkbox like ImageJ1 does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the 2nd approach could be a good solution. Without a (hacky)
</I>&gt;<i> checkbox we would end up with simply not calling preview() on
</I>&gt;<i> Previewable commands. Additionally we could also change this if we wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to support previews in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @interactive commands
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Lee wrote:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; I hadn't looked at the interactive commands with regard to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CellProfiler. It looks like &quot;buttons&quot; could be interpreted as possible
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; headless actions that could be performed... at least in some cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Yes, each button generally performs some action, which we should really
</I>&gt;<i> make sure are always exposed as standalone commands (see next paragraph).
</I>&gt;<i> We are going to add logic to make multiple sequential Button widgets render
</I>&gt;<i> as a single button bar in our UI layout. Won't affect you though, Lee,
</I>&gt;<i> since you do your own UI in Python.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Michael wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why is the threshold  plugin an interactive command?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Let me explain the motivation here. Anything that extends
</I>&gt;<i> InteractiveCommand is not *intended* to be run in headless mode. Rather, it
</I>&gt;<i> is intended as a sort of &quot;meta-command&quot; that allows you to launch other
</I>&gt;<i> commands. It will be filled with callback methods when various inputs
</I>&gt;<i> change, which should, in a properly designed InteractiveCommand, trigger
</I>&gt;<i> real command executions that are more well-behaved from a headless
</I>&gt;<i> standpoint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Anything that extends InteractiveCommand should *not* be flagged with
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;headless = true&quot; since it is not intended for that purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  So in the case of threshold, we need a &quot;real&quot; threshold command that has
</I>&gt;<i> sensible inputs and outputs. Then the command exposed in the ImageJ UI as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;threshold&quot; is actually &quot;Interactive Threshold&quot; which fires off Threshold
</I>&gt;<i> executions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  This is not all fully in place, but it is the direction we are going. Sound
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Lee wrote:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; For Threshold, I can see reasons for executing the callbacks for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;auto&quot;, &quot;apply&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; in a headless context
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The above would also address your comments here, Lee. The interactive
</I>&gt;<i> threshold command would not need to be exposed within CP because those
</I>&gt;<i> buttons would each have a corresponding standalone headless-friendly
</I>&gt;<i> command which *would* be exposed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In our case the standalone headless commands would end up as KNIME nodes
</I>&gt;<i> and the interactive meta command would be ignored.
</I>&gt;<i> Which should work fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have only one small concern, the headless commands should not become to
</I>&gt;<i> fine granular. Consider for example a filter command that supports
</I>&gt;<i> different neighborhood shapes. A meta command for different filters and a
</I>&gt;<i> headless command for each filter (gaussian, max, ...) is a good solution.
</I>&gt;<i> But an implementation with a headless command for each filter and each
</I>&gt;<i> neighbourhood  (gaussian rectangular, gaussian circular, ...) would be too
</I>&gt;<i> much. However thats in the end up to the command implementor and shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> be a general problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @dynamic command detection =&gt; ticket filed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Michael wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is there a way to determine if a command is dynamic?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Other than the hacky instanceof test you are doing, nope. I agree we
</I>&gt;<i> should add API for it to ModuleInfo. Especially because it is possible for
</I>&gt;<i> modules to be dynamic without extending the DynamicCommand class...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Could you please file a ticket for it on the ImageJ Trac? I just made
</I>&gt;<i> ImageJ Trac accounts for you, Christian &amp; Martin; you should have an
</I>&gt;<i> automated email about it. I know Trac is not ideal (GitHub Issues is nice)
</I>&gt;<i> but we have all our ImageJ tickets in Trac now, migrating everything would
</I>&gt;<i> be very involved, and I don't really want to start splitting between two
</I>&gt;<i> issue trackers. Someday we might move...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @plugin jars
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; Are you planing to re-organize the plugins, e.g. such that plugins,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; which are interesting for any application reside in their own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jar-file?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  This is probably a good idea. However, I agree with Lee that in some
</I>&gt;<i> cases it may not be totally clear-cut [1]. You think splitting ij-commands
</I>&gt;<i> into two JAR files is sufficient? If so, care to send a list of plugins you
</I>&gt;<i> feel are *not* generally useful, and I can split them out?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would definitly provide our help for the creation of such a list (at
</I>&gt;<i> least we could look through the plugins and mark the ones that are
</I>&gt;<i> useful within KNIME) however it might be better to delay this until short
</I>&gt;<i> before the final release (final set of plugins, stable plugin system).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @service order  =&gt; ticket filed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Michael wrote:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; we had to move ModuleService behind  MenuService in the constructor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; call to avoid a null pointer during initialization
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (onEvent(ModulesAddedEvent) was called before initialize).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  That is a bug, thanks for reporting. However, moving the module service
</I>&gt;<i> after the menu service will not work because MenuService needs
</I>&gt;<i> CommandService which needs ModuleService.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  What's weird to me is, I am not sure why we don't see this bug when
</I>&gt;<i> running the end-user ImageJ application...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I have some service initialization changes pending on ImageJ's
</I>&gt;<i> startup-speed branch, which may affect this. So we should debug further
</I>&gt;<i> once that branch is merged. Please feel free to file a Trac ticket for it
</I>&gt;<i> and assign to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Michael wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a defined service order?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The order is defined by two things:
</I>&gt;<i>  1) If a service has an @Parameter dependency on another service, the
</I>&gt;<i> dependency gets initialized first.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Otherwise, the &quot;priority&quot; property of the @Plugin annotation is used to
</I>&gt;<i> order service initialization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ((So far, we have tons of ideas where we could do more things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together. Thank you in advance for answering all these questions ;) ))

</I>&gt;<i> p.s.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [1] You know what that easter egg does, right? Don't you *want* to
</I>&gt;<i> generate ASCII images using KNIME??? I know I do!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (-: of course we want. But we don't support getChannelMax/Min atm. so in
</I>&gt;<i> KNIME its only for skilled programmers
