Subject: [ImageJ-devel] autoscaling behavior in IJ2
Message-ID: <CANCtz6fUVcK9ytQ4g5=CHATtP1ddyw1f3fVxAm-MUuXpjaumyA@mail.gmail.com>

So I've been having a heck of a time trying to implement and understand the
IJ 1.0 auto contrast behavior in IJ 2.0.

The current IJ 2 implementation is in
imagej.data.display.AbstractDatasetView.autoscale

You can see the original code here:
http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/developer/source/ij/plugin/frame/ContrastAdjuster.java.html
search for: void autoAdjust

I'm particularly perplexed by the AUTO_THRESHOLD variable.

I'm available on IRC if anyone has a moment to discuss this.

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] IJ1 unit tests
Message-ID: <CADN69y=fn8xceAUEnWvba0stCkwai_SB_br2Jq_6JdQ9En_AgA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Wayne et. al,

For quite some time now, we have had unit tests (written by Barry) for
testing the behavior of IJ1. Unfortunately, they were originally written to
compile against a patched version of IJ1 and we neglected to update them to
work with IJ1 "out of the box."

I have had a ticket about this situation (
http://dev.imagejdev.org/trac/imagej/ticket/598) for the past few months,
but have only just now finally fixed the tests to work against various
versions of IJ1 from 1.44 onwards.

I ran them against all development versions of 1.45 (a through q) and saved
the result as a blog post:
  http://imagejdev.org/2011/10/07/unit-tests-imagej-1x

It looks like from 1.45a through 1.45q, a total of 7 code changes were
introduced that result in test failures. These could be the result of
bugfixes, or they could be new regressions. I wanted to let you know in case
you were interested in pursuing these bugs, since I know how much you value
backwards compatibility.

Instructions on running the tests yourself can be found here:
  http://imagejdev.org/source-code#Running_ImageJ_1.x_unit_tests

My plan is to hook up the tests to Hudson (http://dev.imagejdev.org:8080/)
and have it send an email whenever a new version of IJ1 is released with
failing tests.

What do you think?

Regards,
Curtis

The data files are included in the ImageJ2 SVN checkout, in the folder:
  ij1-tests/src/test/resources/data

You can also download them from this URL:

http://dev.imagejdev.org/svn/imagej/trunk/ij1-tests/src/test/resources/data/

Hi Curtis,

I am willing to try to figure out why the tests are failing. I thought I would start with the virtual stack tests so I converted VirtualStackTest.java to an ImageJ plugin (attached), but I can't get it to run because I can't find the files "gray8-2x3-sub1.tif" and "gray8-2x3-sub2.tif" on the imagejdev website and I don't know how to generate them.

Thanks for investigating. Barry is updating the tests now in response to
your comments, and will reply with any remaining issues. We should have all
the tests passing again very soon, and will get them automated soon as well.

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1110141237280.32316@s15462909.onlinehome-server.info>


It is not needed, and the AppleJavaExtensions.jar does not provide
that package anyway. So this is needed to build ImageJ1 with Maven
on non-MacOSX.

	Hi Wayne,

	For debugging purposes, we try to integrate the build process of 
	ij.jar into our ImageJ2 workflow. A side effect is that Fiji will 
	run with a standard ij.jar very soon now.

	But when I try to build ImageJ1's sources with Maven, it complains 
	about the package com.apple.mrj not being found in 
	AppleJavaExtensions.jar (which is provided by Apple to compile 
	stuff for MacOSX on other platforms, such as my Linux setup).

	Wayne, may I ask you to apply this patch? It should not change 
	things on your side, but it will fix build errors here.

	Thanks!
	Johannes

Message-ID: <CAJj13_8sxOCQ-XtbzvLX2TnxB9rbP9yuq0ays+ya9Ssz7P_GmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Melissa, Curtis, Johannes,

Thoughts on large files. ImageJ 1 cannot open images larger than the
maximum signed int value, but there is no reason why ImageJ 2
shouldn't be able to.

Are you guys planning for imglib2 on a PlanarCellContainer that
behaves like a PlanarArrayContainer that has been internally chopped
up into as many cells as necessary, circumventing the array size
limit? And given the large size, extra bonus if the file is lazily
loaded, that is, each cell is loaded on demand from the large file on
disk.

>From some time ago I recall having heard or read that LOCI Bioformats
can already read ROIs from images in disk. Is that right? If you could
point me to an example that would b appreciated.

What motivated the above is that we are currently dealing with 32k x
32k 16-bit images, which we had to cut into tiles. And larger images
are bound to come.

Albert

Sure, we can start with a placeholder image and switch to a better one any
time before the release. There's nothing to say we can't update the image
between beta releases either, so no rush on it. We could even have the About
dialog choose a random image from a pool (as long as we keep the JAR size
small). Before December would be best though.

Thanks,
Curtis

Yes, we can use some now as placeholder, and I really like the idea of 
rotating through them as in spirit of project to represent multiple groups.

I won't pretend to know anything about imglib, but for what it's
worth it is possible to read small tiles from images using Bio-Formats (as you
likely already know).  See this method in IFormatReader:

http://git.openmicroscopy.org/?p=bioformats.git;a=blob;f=components/bio-formats/src/loci/formats/IFormatReader.java#l236

Unless the whole image is compressed as a single stream, opening a
small tile will not cause the entire image to be read.

Bio-Formats can read ROIs stored in some file formats, e.g. Zeiss LSM.
A brand new example of how to work with the parsed ROIs is available here:

http://git.openmicroscopy.org/?p=bioformats.git;a=blob;f=components/bio-formats/utils/PrintROIs.java

See also loci.plugins.util.ROIHandler, which translates ROIs read using
Bio-Formats into ImageJ ROIs:

http://git.openmicroscopy.org/?p=bioformats.git;a=blob;f=components/loci-plugins/src/loci/plugins/util/ROIHandler.java

In writing the example I remembered just how painful it is to work with
ROIs using the current API, so if either of those examples is unclear
please let me know.

Regards,
-Melissa

Message-ID: <CALmP0ELdTw2R6C6d1pUXQ8ujAc0jHZqk7HHjYcYF=7j90VuFMg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Fist I'd like to introduce me as it is my first post here... Cellular
neurobiologist, interested in microscopy, long-time ImageJ user (member of
ImageJ and Fiji mailing lists), macro programmer. Unfortunately still Java
illiterate (though I'm planning to learn), so I can't contribute to
technical discussion nor really participate in IJ2 dev.

Anyway I've stumbled upon the ImageJ-devel post for new "About" images in
IJ2, so I thought maybe I could at least contribute something. Here are two
candidates that ressemble the original IJ image. These are COS cells in
culture, labeled for nucleus (DAPI), microtubules (alpha-tubulin) and
microtubule plus ends (EB3). This are quite large so a crop is definitely
possible.

First image:
http://www.cleterrier.net/up/IJ2_AboutImage1.png

Second image:
http://www.cleterrier.net/up/IJ2_AboutImage2.png

By the way, maybe having several image and choosing one of them when calling
"About..." would help reflect the diversity of applications for ImageJ. Or
even better, a rotating image background (although I have no idea how
complicated it is to implement). As an exemple and a bit of a shameless
plug, on my personal website I have a randomly-rotating banner picture
showing some microscopy images: http://www.cleterrier.net/ (reload the page
to change the banner picture).

Cheers,

Christophe

Some ideas about the "about" image. In Fibonacci order:

1. What about making this an open contest and advertise a bit mode widely it 
in the IJ and Fiji lists perhaps?, rather than IJ-devel only? 
We might otherwise be missing lots of interesting stuff. 
Also that would it make people feel a bit more interested  in the development 
of IJ2.

2. Relax the theme and let's see what other images than cells people submit. 

3. I also think that we would want to see what the images would look like at 
the intended resolution of the about window, so I suggest the images should be 
submitted at that size, reduced or cropped to avoid disappointment when 
reducing them (and detail being lost) or scaling artifacts.
Maybe this can be done in some of the wikis (the Tudor one has, I think, a 
plugin (?) for polls that might be possible to adapt to this?).

5. There are lots of interesting and beautiful images for which it would be 
difficult or impossible to read any text overwritten on them, so an idea would 
be to use the images with an artificial darkening horizontal gradient or 
similar so the text is readable.

8. I like the idea of various images alternating or randomly used for this, so 
perhaps there could be a pool of sample images to choose from at run time. If 
space is an issue, when the about samples folder is not existent or empty the 
about window could use just a default image stored in the jar file or a blank 
frame.

Hi Gabriel,

These are great ideas, and we will definitely explore having some sort of rotating image to best represent the diverse use of the community. I really like that. ?However that will happen later after ImageJ2 is released as non-beta and hardened in regular use. At this point we just need a few images to put in there as a place holder for the first release.

Another idea would be to design the dialog in a way that it can use a
rotation of images.

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Release of OMERO 4.3.3
Message-ID: <27AF2D10-9E1A-425C-A2F9-7D61BA4345E6@lifesci.dundee.ac.uk>

Dear All-

Today, The OME Consortium (http://openmicroscopy.org/site/about/development-teams), is proud to release OMERO-Beta4.3.3.

This is a point release, focussing on fixes for ImageJ integration, export, and LDAP.   We also fixed a few things in OMERO.insight and OMERO.web.  

Full details are available at http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/milestone/OMERO-Beta4.3.3

The software is available at http://openmicroscopy.org

For those of you new to OMERO, see  http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero

The full list of features in OMERO, including new features in OMERO Beta4.3.3, is at 

http://openmicroscopy.org/site/products/feature-list

Much of our work over the last few weeks has been devoted to updating the (very popular!!!) movies demo'ing OMERO functionality on that page.  Most are updated for 4.3.2, and won't have changed in 4.3.3-- we hope you like them.  Any problems, do let us know.

Our thanks to a number of posts on our forums that picked up bugs and problems in 4.3.2.  We prioritise addressing these community issues.  The 4.3.3 page lists the reports, and the fixes we've done.  

*******************************

The OME Team is now hard at work on our next release, provisionally titled OMERO Beta4.4.  Confusingly, these are currently in a different milestone:

http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/milestone/OMERO-Beta4.4

We'll get this all resolved over the next few days.  However, the overall theme here is important to note-- integration with other projects will be our focus over the next many months.  In 4.4, we want to have a solid foundation for this integration for us, and others.

Comments and ideas are welcome, on the Forums or on these lists.

In collaboration with Urban Liebel at  Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, we are providing demo accounts for OMERO.  Use the Demo link at openmicroscopy.org to contact us if you are interested in this.

Our feedback system, OMERO.qa (http://qa.openmicroscopy.org.uk) is a facility users and developers can use to log comments and exceptions.  OMERO.qa supports uploading of problematic data files, and tracking of responses to any user queries.  

As always, thanks for your support.

Cheers,

Jason

Yes that effect looks nice (the font is not very readable though).
Maybe one can just operate on the image with an already antialiased text with 
the shadow. That should be quicker?

I just wanted to say that the readability is a solvable problem.

I agree with all of your ideas, and have filed a ticket about it:

For now I assigned it to the 2.0 final release milestone.

Absolutely. This has been a goal of IJ2 from the beginning. However, given
the magnitude of the project, the first release will not provide a full
solution. However, the architecture (i.e., ImgLib2) is in place for a full
solution to be implemented in a reasonable time frame.

Relevant tickets in our issue tracking system include:
  http://dev.imagejdev.org/trac/imagej/ticket/19
  http://dev.imagejdev.org/trac/imagej/ticket/216

As Aivar notes in one of ticket #19's comments, he began development at the
last Fiji hackathon on a tiled image viewer for
ImageJ<http://dev.imagejdev.org/trac/imagej/browser/trunk/zoomviewer/src/imagej/display/zoomview>.
We plan to pursue this capability further early next year.

Are you guys planning for imglib2 on a PlanarCellContainer that

Yes, we don't have a ticket for it yet, but it is very similar to #216. We
will definitely need to create an ImgLib2 cell container (of which a planar
cell container is just a special case). It will be needed not only for
tiling, but also for caching image processing operations on huge datasets in
general. For example, you can currently open a 200GB dataset (e.g., 1024 x
1024 x 100 focal planes x 1000 time points x 16-bit) as a virtual stack. But
you can't easily process every plane with a plugin filter and then keep
browsing the processed planes. With a cell container that caches out blocks
to disk as needed, it would at least be possible, if slow. And this
capability would make it easier to implement undo as well, since prior
dataset states could be cached to and from disk in a similar way.

Regards,
Curtis

Hi all!

Attached are the cleaned up versions of the icon and a jpg (for now) of the
scope logo at about 512px. I'll make sure to send you guys all the sources
later and I'll include a png on transparency of the larger version. Just
wanted to get you something to look at.

Cheers!
Adam

Sorry to be critical, but the perspective seems to be wrong making the 
microscope to look odd.

If you one see both sides proximal and distal of the revolving piece, then one 
cannot see the connection between the bronze and black tube as horizontal 
lines. The perspective of the top and bottom do not match.

What about using something like the image below, possibly converted to vector 
graphics?

http://www.arsmachina.com/images/watson1354-2.jpg

Those are the same people from where Wayne used the image for IJ, and they 
seemed to be OK being used. Maybe they can be approached again.

Cheers

The drawing is essentially verbatim from a photograph that Johannes & I

  https://www.dropbox.com/gallery/5695175/1//microscopes?h=a9095a

Specifically, check out image 14 of 38.

Unfortunately, Adam is leaving the team, and will not have time to develop
any more vectorized images. Also, keep in mind that the image must be simple
enough to be discernible at various smaller resolutions including 32x32 and
even 16x16 (with a little tweaking).

Perhaps we should do a similar thing for the logo as with the About dialog
images: let's hold an open contest where people can submit candidate logos,
and then the community can vote on the one they like best. What do you
think?

Regards,
Curtis

Yes, exactly, if you brighten it, it shows that the bottom brass piece of the 
main tube (attached to the revolving piece is oncave (while the logo is 
completely horizontal). And the top one (at the ocular piece should be 
slightly convex.
As it stands it mixes 2 different perspectives in a single object... but... 
thinking about it, Picasso did not do too bad with that approach :-)

Sorry to hear that... Yes, sure the drawing has a lot of work and maybe when 
reduced it is not even noticeable.

Also perhaps with a little of retouching that can be changed to match the 
picture. Are the vector graphics editable and available?

Hi Gabriel (et al.),

I appreciate your critical eye, and I see the part that you're keying in on.

As Curtis said, the image is near verbatim from the photo (I straightened
out the scope so it's vertical to clean up aliasing).

Anyway, take a close look at the one of the top-down views of the scope.
You'll notice that the objective mount is actually shifted towards the back
side (wrt the logo angle) of the scope. This is the reason that it appears
so strange?it IS actually tilted towards the viewing perspective of the
logo.

This bugs me as much as it bugs you, so I've Attached is a minor revision
that I think confuses the viewer less.

-Adam

PS: I LOVE the other scope image you sent, but unfortunately that'd take
some serious time to rebuild in Photoshop, and there's a good chance that it
won't be very discernable as a small icon. Anyway, today's my last day of
work here, so yeah... tweaks only please! :)

I think that what makes the tube look a bit strange is the lower boundary.
I assume that the horizon is somewhere where the focusing knob is so the lower 
end needs to be slightly curved.
Have a look at the attached image. If that border can be made curved instead 
of horizontal I think it would be better.

Sure I understand, and of course I opened my mouth with a constructive intent. 
We want the best imaging program to have the best logo ;-)

Best of luck in your next move!

Potrace in Inkscape did a reasonable job. See attachments.

But I like the microscope in your icon better.

Hi Wayne,

I wanted to follow up on a patch that Dscho sent a while back, regarding
the line "import com.apple.mrj.*;" in the MacAdapter.source file. Would it
be possible to remove this line of code? It causes a compilation error on
non-Mac platforms.

The reason that "import com.apple.eawt.*;" is OK is because we depend on
AppleJavaExtensions.jar (see
http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/AppleJavaExtensions/Introduction/Intro.html),
which is Apple's official way of compiling Apple-specific code on non-Mac
platforms. But unfortunately the AppleJavaExtensions does not include stubs
for the old com.apple.mrj.* classes.

Thanks,
Curtis
