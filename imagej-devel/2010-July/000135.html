Hi Stephan,

sorry, I somehow did not get that there was this session yesterday.


No worries; we weren't expecting you guys to attend. It went for several
hours, and a big part of it was for everybody here to learn about imglib, so
it probably would have been a bit boring for you. ;-)

I had a look at the ImgLibProcessor and in general it looks good. I have
some comments what could be done more optimized. Should we go over it maybe
on Monday in a short Skype session?


Great, discussing it briefly on Monday sounds good. We had some questions
for you as well (many noted as &quot;TODO&quot; in the code). How about 3pm Dresden
(8am Madison) time?

Hi everyone,

Yesterday the ImageJDev.org developers spent a few hours together,
attempting an initial integration of imglib with ImageJ.

We ended up (partially) implementing a new ImageProcessor subclass called
ImgLibProcessor that is backed by an mpicbg.imglib.image.Image&lt;T extends
ComplexType&lt;T&gt;&gt; object. This basic proof of concept is available from our
Git repository:

<A HREF="http://imagejdev.org/trac/imagej/changeset/3b073b3a34fae55c6e8aa0de9da210c54">http://imagejdev.org/trac/imagej/changeset/3b073b3a34fae55c6e8aa0de9da210c54</A>
d558054

For those interested, the ij.process.ImgLibProcessor class has a main method
to test the functionality; the image used must be grayscale, and either a
single image or a Z-series, due to current limitations in imglib's LOCI
Bio-Formats image importer.

We also identified several next steps to take to further pursue this work:

1) Resolve the multichannel issue/limitations

2) Implement the many unimplemented imglib processor methods

3) Investigate the ImageStatistics subclasses-maybe create an analogous
ImgLibStatistics class?

4) Identify the places within ImageJ where type-specific case logic is used
  * Add a case for the new imglib backed structure at these locations

5) More generally, add getters/setters for all public fields throughout
ImageJ, to assist with delegation logic in the future

Overall, the coding session was a success-people felt like they learned
quite a bit-so we will probably do another one in 2-4 weeks, assuming we
have another appropriate topic.

-Curtis
