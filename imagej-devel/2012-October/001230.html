<PRE>Hi Jason,

Thanks for the thorough summary.

&gt;<i> -- do we agree to use scijava to start this discussion?
</I>
Yes, I agree that the scijava mailing list is the best place for further
discussion:
    <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scijava">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scijava</A>

&gt;<i> -- can we put materials, discussions we each have there?
</I>
Indeed, though I think technical materials should go into the
@scijava/roi-model repository:
    <A HREF="https://github.com/scijava/roi-model">https://github.com/scijava/roi-model</A>

We can add anyone interested in contributing to the committers list. (Or
you can fork it and submit a PR; either way.)

Figuring out how to organize everything might be a bit tricky, though.

&gt;<i> -- date for meeting&#8212;is there another scheduled event we should
</I>&gt;<i> piggyback on? (Note I think things like the ImageJ mtg are not a good
</I>&gt;<i> idea; too many other things going on)
</I>
Well, the ImageJ conference (Oct 24-26) is the only time I will be in the
EU otherwise. So no, there is no other meeting that would be convenient for
me personally to piggyback on.

&gt;<i> -- everyone OK with Dundee for mtg place??
</I>
Dundee is OK with me, as far as the EU goes. That said, I was recently
lamenting how (with respect to international flights) all of our groups are
based in smaller cities off the proverbial beaten path: Dundee, Dresden,
Madison, Konstanz... But Paris (Pasteur) &amp; Boston (Broad/CellProfiler) are
also represented here! Maybe the big city folks want to organize one of
these shindigs in the future?

Regards,
Curtis

&gt;<i>  Dear All-
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm writing following various discussions  regarding the definition and
</I>&gt;<i> use of a common specification for multi-dimensional regions for biological
</I>&gt;<i> imaging, and in particular biological microscopy.  I am cc'ing Michael
</I>&gt;<i> Unser, Wiro Niessen and Antje Keppler on this email for reasons that I will
</I>&gt;<i> describe below.  I've also included representation from OME, ImageJDev,
</I>&gt;<i> KNIME, Icy, and CellProfiler.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first concrete discussion on a common ROI spec was held in April in
</I>&gt;<i> Barcelona.  Josh Moore's notes were circulated earlier (also, see below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We now have an opportunity to finish this specification.  This follows
</I>&gt;<i> from meetings sponsored by Euro-BioImaging (<A HREF="http://eurobioimaging.eu">http://eurobioimaging.eu</A>),
</I>&gt;<i> and in particular The Data Management Work Package (often referred to as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;WP11&quot;), led by Wiro and Michael, and which I, through our work on OME,
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to.  Through WP11, we have funds to sponsor a meeting that moves
</I>&gt;<i> a common ROI spec towards completion.  The idea is to have a common
</I>&gt;<i> specification, and example &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; software implementation(s) in
</I>&gt;<i> at least a few of our projects, so that a region defined in one image
</I>&gt;<i> software package can be used by another.  The emphasis is on transport and
</I>&gt;<i> interop, and not, for example, on a single library for defining, using ROIs
</I>&gt;<i> that must be used by all.  We already know the kind and level of
</I>&gt;<i> standardization that works, and that which does not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the progress we made in Barcelona, it seems that this is not a
</I>&gt;<i> fantasy, but an achievable goal.  We don't propose a standard meeting with
</I>&gt;<i> presentations, etc., but more of a developer meeting or &quot;hackathon&quot;, that
</I>&gt;<i> has been so successfully used by the ImageJ/Fiji teams and others.  We need
</I>&gt;<i> to work through the specification (ideally making some progress beforehand
</I>&gt;<i> using the various electronic tools we all know and love), and then get at
</I>&gt;<i> least rough implementations in place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a start, we've used the scijava.org site that was defined at the
</I>&gt;<i> Dresden ImageJ/Fiji hackathon in Dec 2011.  See:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.scijava.org/">http://www.scijava.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As this was where our projects agreed to work together at the Dresden
</I>&gt;<i> hackathon, it seemed a place where we could do this work, but this is not
</I>&gt;<i> at all mandatory&#8212; just a place to start.  Whatever we use, it has to be
</I>&gt;<i> usable for modern code development (in my opinion, that means, it has to be
</I>&gt;<i> github or better, but other opinions welcome).  Obviously other resources
</I>&gt;<i> can link to this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Below &#8220;Resources&#8221;, there is now a link to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.scijava.org/roi-model/">http://www.scijava.org/roi-model/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On this page are Josh Moore's notes from the Barcelona mtg.  With Lee
</I>&gt;<i> Kamentsky's permission we can add his SpaceROI.xsd (email from 30 April),
</I>&gt;<i> or a more recent update to it.  Roger Leigh (OME) has added his work on a
</I>&gt;<i> draft model spec.  He can explain what is going on there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the mtg itself, we propose two possible dates&#8212; Nov 12-14 or Dec 10-12.
</I>&gt;<i>  There are obviously several looming conflicts&#8212; US Thanksgiving, ASCB in
</I>&gt;<i> SF, and several others.  I believe there is also an ImageJ hackathon
</I>&gt;<i> looming.  So far there is strong preference for the November date.
</I>&gt;<i>  Obviously minimising trans-ocean flights helps productivity and keeps us
</I>&gt;<i> all in good graces with our families.  Wilma Woudenberg will send out a
</I>&gt;<i> poll and we can try to get this nailed down.  If those dates don't work, we
</I>&gt;<i> can go sooner or later, so speak up, but would be great to get this done
</I>&gt;<i> before end of 2012.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For location, we've discussed Dresden, Dundee, and there may be others.
</I>&gt;<i>  Through Euro-BioImaging, Dundee has funds to sponsor the meeting, and to
</I>&gt;<i> support travel for participants (economy only).  If possible, Dundee will
</I>&gt;<i> do all travel arrangements, to save the fun of travel reimbursements from
</I>&gt;<i> EU grants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't exactly sure who was interested, and we don't yet have a single
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list that covers all of us, although the SciJava google group (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scijava">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scijava</A>) has been used
</I>&gt;<i> for some  discussions.    This problem will get worse when we need our
</I>&gt;<i> various developers to talk to each other.  I know many of the OME devs read
</I>&gt;<i> the ImageJdev list, but that is not universal.  Note that some of the email
</I>&gt;<i> lists included require registration, so do we use <A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-devel">scijava at googlegroups</A>?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, this a too long email.  Decisions needed:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- do we agree to use scijava to start this discussion?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- can we put materials, discussions we each have there?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- date for meeting&#8212;is there another scheduled event we should piggyback
</I>&gt;<i> on? (Note I think things like the ImageJ mtg are not a good idea; too many
</I>&gt;<i> other things going on)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- everyone OK with Dundee for mtg place??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note: I'm partial to Dundee, since we have to pay for everything, so it
</I>&gt;<i> saves admin hassle, but if this can be solved easily, then that's fine.
</I>&gt;<i>  Wilma will take care of Doodle polls and very likely travel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've worked together well in the past, so hopefully we can get this done,
</I>&gt;<i> and build something that will truly help our scientist users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
