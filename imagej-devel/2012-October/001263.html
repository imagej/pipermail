IJ1 plugins have the advantage that it works with IJ1, true. But they are
limited to the data types of IJ1. Depending on your Java skills, you might
want to use ImgLib2. There will be good tutorials on our Wiki soon.

It really depends what you want to do. If all you want is to write a
simple ImageJ1 plugin, the best idea would be to clone and enhance

	<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/minimal-ij1-plugin">https://github.com/imagej/minimal-ij1-plugin</A>

As to the newest commit:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/fiji/fiji">https://github.com/fiji/fiji</A>

has it. Depending on my mood, I push to GitHub or fiji.sc and ImageJ's
Jenkins synchronizes them. You might have had a look too quickly, before
Jenkins could push it.

In any case, the problem in your existing ImageJ2 clone (without
re-fetching!) should be gone because the Maven repository was updated. All
you need to do is ask Netbeans to update the Maven dependencies.

Ciao,
Johannes
