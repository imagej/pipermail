<PRE>Hi Justin,

Thanks for your reply, and sorry for the delay in my response.



&gt;<i> &gt;Did you try to build the code as-is
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I&#8217;m down from an original 8000 compilation errors in basic ImageJ to
</I>&gt;<i> 3000 by writing wrappers to map Java AWT components to basic Android ones.
</I>

Interesting. Did you see this project: <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/sdf4j/">http://code.google.com/p/sdf4j/</A>

It might be worthwhile to create an ImageJ2 SDF4J UI that would be
compatible with both AWT-based JVMs and Android (since those are the two
existing implementations so far).

Also, are you talking about ImageJ 1.x, or ImageJ2? With ImageJ2, no AWT
wrappers should be necessary; rather, you can implement a different UI
using the Android UI classes (or perhaps even SDF4J, mentioned above).




They are very similar, but some incompatibilities makes totally as-is
&gt;<i> ImageJ difficult, and ImgLib impossible, so I have:
</I>
**


I am interested to hear why ImgLib on Android is impossible. Are there
changes we can make to the library to fix that? If so, we should do it
sooner rather than later. The longer we wait to make architectural or API
changes to the code, the more difficult it will become, due to increasing
usage in the wild. And once ImgLib2 and ImageJ2 come out of beta we will be
committed to maintaining backwards API compatibility, which complicates
things.




&gt;<i> &gt; Did you try the Maven Android plugin (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin">https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin</A>)?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but I actually found that I had to substantially un-mavenize ImgLib

</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse debugger, frequently going across dependencies in figuring out
</I>&gt;<i> bugs.  Understanding how to get this to work better with Maven is probably

Definitely, I would be happy to help. You should certainly not have to
un-Mavenize these projects. On the contrary, the M2E plugin is supposed to
make dependency management in Eclipse better and more powerful. There are
two ways of doing it: 1) import the actual Maven projects (in which case
you can debug into and even change the source code on the fly), or 2)
right-click the Maven JAR dependency and select &quot;Maven &gt; Download Sources&quot;
to download and link a source code JAR (in which case you can debug into,
but not change, the linked source code).




&gt;<i> &gt; Did you think about creating an HTML5/Javascript frontend to an ImageJ
</I>&gt;<i> server, for cross-platform mobile support?
</I>&gt;<i> This is something I saw a lot of people doing at a recent medical imaging
</I>&gt;<i> conference, but not specifically for mobile support (but that is a
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable next step).  Do you know of any examples of just general-purpose
</I>&gt;<i> applications that have done this for cross-platform mobile use?
</I>
**

**

**

I have not done a lot of research, but some basic searches yield e.g. many
YouTube videos talking about cross-platform mobile development using HTML5.
&gt;<i>From a cursory inspection, it looks quite doable, though there are surely
</I>many pitfalls (e.g., no position:fixed on iOS 4!).


One video I saw (<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij5YWGiGSMU#t=16m39s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij5YWGiGSMU#t=16m39s</A>) goes
into a fair amount of detail discussing cross-platform mobile HTML5
development, and comparison to native apps. But that video is already
almost two years old, and given how fast HTML5 is growing, it's hard to say
what the current state of affairs is without more extensive research and
experimentation.


In any case, I'm looking forward to hearing your talk at the conference.
Hopefully we will have time to hack on some code. Note that I will be in
Luxembourg until Sunday the 28th, to discuss and work on projects a little
afterward.


Regards,

Curtis

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope things are going well with you. I am writing regarding your talk on

</I>&gt;<i> ** **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From your abstract (

</I>&gt;<i> it sounds like you encountered quite a few difficulties. Anything you would
</I>&gt;<i> care to discuss prior to the conference? Leaving the door open for mobile
</I>&gt;<i> support has been a major design goal of ImageJ2, so if there are roadblocks
</I>&gt;<i> it would be good to hear about them, to make any corrections in the
</I>&gt;<i> architecture sooner rather than later.****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, in general, we would be very interested to hear details of your

</I>&gt;<i> welcome to discuss your findings on this mailing list, and/or post
