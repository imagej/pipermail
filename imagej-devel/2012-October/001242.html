<PRE>I'm pretty sure I'll go to the meeting - both sets of dates are OK for 
me. I'll check in again when the plans become final and make the 
necessary arrangements. I think it would be useful if we could have some 
sort of scratchpad or wiki to discuss the spec prior to going. I have 
one or two use-cases that are challenging and also I want to plan how to 
address scalability issues and possibly benchmark a couple of approaches 
on real data.

</I>&gt;<i> Dear All-
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm writing following various discussions  regarding the definition 
</I>&gt;<i> and use of a common specification for multi-dimensional regions for 
</I>&gt;<i> biological imaging, and in particular biological microscopy.  I am 
</I>&gt;<i> cc'ing Michael Unser, Wiro Niessen and Antje Keppler on this email for 
</I>&gt;<i> reasons that I will describe below.  I've also included representation 
</I>&gt;<i> from OME, ImageJDev, KNIME, Icy, and CellProfiler.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first concrete discussion on a common ROI spec was held in April 
</I>&gt;<i> in Barcelona.  Josh Moore's notes were circulated earlier (also, see 
</I>&gt;<i> below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We now have an opportunity to finish this specification.  This follows 
</I>&gt;<i> from meetings sponsored by Euro-BioImaging (<A HREF="http://eurobioimaging.eu">http://eurobioimaging.eu</A>), 
</I>&gt;<i> and in particular The Data Management Work Package (often referred to 
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;WP11&quot;), led by Wiro and Michael, and which I, through our work on 
</I>&gt;<i> OME, contribute to.  Through WP11, we have funds to sponsor a meeting 
</I>&gt;<i> that moves a common ROI spec towards completion.  The idea is to have 
</I>&gt;<i> a common specification, and example &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; software 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation(s) in at least a few of our projects, so that a region 
</I>&gt;<i> defined in one image software package can be used by another.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> emphasis is on transport and interop, and not, for example, on a 
</I>&gt;<i> single library for defining, using ROIs that must be used by all.  We 
</I>&gt;<i> already know the kind and level of standardization that works, and 
</I>&gt;<i> that which does not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the progress we made in Barcelona, it seems that this is not a 
</I>&gt;<i> fantasy, but an achievable goal.  We don't propose a standard meeting 
</I>&gt;<i> with presentations, etc., but more of a developer meeting or 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;hackathon&quot;, that has been so successfully used by the ImageJ/Fiji 
</I>&gt;<i> teams and others.  We need to work through the specification (ideally 
</I>&gt;<i> making some progress beforehand using the various electronic tools we 
</I>&gt;<i> all know and love), and then get at least rough implementations in place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a start, we've used the scijava.org site that was defined at the 
</I>&gt;<i> Dresden ImageJ/Fiji hackathon in Dec 2011.  See:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.scijava.org/">http://www.scijava.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As this was where our projects agreed to work together at the Dresden 
</I>&gt;<i> hackathon, it seemed a place where we could do this work, but this is 
</I>&gt;<i> not at all mandatory&#8212; just a place to start.  Whatever we use, it has 
</I>&gt;<i> to be usable for modern code development (in my opinion, that means, 
</I>&gt;<i> it has to be github or better, but other opinions welcome).  Obviously 
</I>&gt;<i> other resources can link to this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Below &#8220;Resources&#8221;, there is now a link to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.scijava.org/roi-model/">http://www.scijava.org/roi-model/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On this page are Josh Moore's notes from the Barcelona mtg.  With Lee 
</I>&gt;<i> Kamentsky's permission we can add his SpaceROI.xsd (email from 30 
</I>&gt;<i> April), or a more recent update to it.  Roger Leigh (OME) has added 
</I>&gt;<i> his work on a draft model spec.  He can explain what is going on there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the mtg itself, we propose two possible dates&#8212; Nov 12-14 or Dec 
</I>&gt;<i> 10-12.  There are obviously several looming conflicts&#8212; US 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanksgiving, ASCB in SF, and several others.  I believe there is also 
</I>&gt;<i> an ImageJ hackathon looming.  So far there is strong preference for 
</I>&gt;<i> the November date.  Obviously minimising trans-ocean flights helps 
</I>&gt;<i> productivity and keeps us all in good graces with our families.  Wilma 
</I>&gt;<i> Woudenberg will send out a poll and we can try to get this nailed 
</I>&gt;<i> down.  If those dates don't work, we can go sooner or later, so speak 
</I>&gt;<i> up, but would be great to get this done before end of 2012.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For location, we've discussed Dresden, Dundee, and there may be 
</I>&gt;<i> others.  Through Euro-BioImaging, Dundee has funds to sponsor the 
</I>&gt;<i> meeting, and to support travel for participants (economy only).  If 
</I>&gt;<i> possible, Dundee will do all travel arrangements, to save the fun of 
</I>&gt;<i> travel reimbursements from EU grants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't exactly sure who was interested, and we don't yet have a 
</I>&gt;<i> single mailing list that covers all of us, although the SciJava google 
</I>&gt;<i> group (<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scijava">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scijava</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#%21forum/scijava">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#%21forum/scijava</A>&gt;) has 
</I>&gt;<i> been used for some  discussions.    This problem will get worse when 
</I>&gt;<i> we need our various developers to talk to each other.  I know many of 
</I>&gt;<i> the OME devs read the ImageJdev list, but that is not universal.  Note 
</I>&gt;<i> that some of the email lists included require registration, so do we 
</I>&gt;<i> use <A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-devel">scijava at googlegroups</A>?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, this a too long email.  Decisions needed:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- do we agree to use scijava to start this discussion?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- can we put materials, discussions we each have there?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- date for meeting&#8212;is there another scheduled event we should 
</I>&gt;<i> piggyback on? (Note I think things like the ImageJ mtg are not a good 
</I>&gt;<i> idea; too many other things going on)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- everyone OK with Dundee for mtg place??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note: I'm partial to Dundee, since we have to pay for everything, so 
</I>&gt;<i> it saves admin hassle, but if this can be solved easily, then that's 
</I>&gt;<i> fine.  Wilma will take care of Doodle polls and very likely travel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've worked together well in the past, so hopefully we can get this 
</I>&gt;<i> done, and build something that will truly help our scientist users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jason
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. As Euro-BioImaging will sponsor meeting, the various leaders of 
</I>&gt;<i> WP11 and also Antje Keppler, Euro-BioImaging PM are cc'd.
