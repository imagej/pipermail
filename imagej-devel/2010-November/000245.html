<PRE>Hi Albert,

I could see how using ShapeLists could work well for us for most cases 
seeing that we mostly use 2-d. It looks to me like you need one shape 
per z-plane in 3-d? I am thinking that there is still some utility in 
having something that represents the segmentation or labeling as a 
whole. In that scheme, the shapes would be views into the underlying 
representation of the labeling. Finally, I think there is some utility 
to a localizable cursor that doesn't use shapes as an intermediate 
because that sort of cursor would only visit labeled pixels whereas the 
shape cursor, at best, visits all pixels in the shape's bounding box 
(and for naive uses, might visit all pixels in the image). Some 
labelings, such as those on neurons, are sparse within their bounding 
boxes and, it seems to me, would require many calls to 
java.awt.Shape.contains(x,y).
