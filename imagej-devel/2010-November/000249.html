<PRE>Lots of good points Gabriel,
If I understand right, you'd like the perimeter points in this order:

     1.....2
    3........4
    5...6 7...8
     9.10 11.12

(or do you want all the points, not just the ends, in clockwise order?)

We could store it that way internally - an efficient run-length encoding 
and easy enough to use it to build all of the cursors. The 
eight-connected compression scheme is elegant; that would be a great 
storage format.

Your point regarding the perimeter is well-taken; the perimeter is 
typically greater than the count of the pixels that make up the 
perimeter. I suppose you're right about area as well, but the magnitude 
of the error is far less.

</I>&gt;<i> Good. Yes, there is a definite advantage one has all the blobs labelled to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to target each one from a table of positions rather than going all over
</I>&gt;<i> the image. I mentioned StartZ (I realised now that in IJ these are called
</I>&gt;<i> XStart, etc) but currently there is no native method to isolate 3D blobs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The outline pixels can be recovered from a list of pixel coordinates for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each label by sorting the coordinates by x then y and finding the ones
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without y neighbors on either side, and then sorting by y, then x and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repeating, although labeling using Chang is clearly more efficient if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you have a binary thresholding of the image.
</I>&gt;<i> Here is where Freeman's algorithm (walking around each blob) is efficient
</I>&gt;<i> because it gives the boundary already sorted in the sequence along of the
</I>&gt;<i> walk. Currently IJ uses a different algorithm to compute the perimeter length.
</I>&gt;<i> (results for large blobs are similar to Freeman's but if I recall correctly
</I>&gt;<i> there is some discrepancy for small ones). Also IJ uses the number of pixels
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;area&quot;. While some might not bother too much about this detail, others
</I>&gt;<i> might think differently (me included :-) ). If a pixel is a point, the area
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be 1 and it should have no perimeter and no circularity, etc. Freeman's
</I>&gt;<i> encoding solves this, I think, a bit better and we should try to provide both,
</I>&gt;<i> area inside the bounding perimeter and number of pixels in the blob.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also one wants that perimeter sorted for a number of other reasons. For
</I>&gt;<i> example one can compute the yardstick fractal dimension using this sorted list
</I>&gt;<i> of coordinates. And one can also use this list and save the blob outlines as a
</I>&gt;<i> chain encoded profile (this is used by some imaging systems). The file size is
</I>&gt;<i> minuscule as it encodes one of the 8 possible positions of the next pixel and
</I>&gt;<i> one can pack several &quot;next positions&quot; per byte).
</I>&gt;<i> After going round the profile and one reaches the starting pixel (plus
</I>&gt;<i> checking that the pixel at x-1, y+1 is either visited or empty, if not one
</I>&gt;<i> still has some boundary to walk) one already has the perimeter and the area
</I>&gt;<i> under the enclosed perimeter. So one can compute circularity in one operation.
</I>&gt;<i> The cursor could return the perimeter length and the area enclosed by the
</I>&gt;<i> perimeter. But now that the perimeter has been computer, one can also extract
</I>&gt;<i> the convex hull from the sorted list, and the convex area, and once you have
</I>&gt;<i> the convex hull, the feret diameter is computed easily, and its angle with the
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal frame, and the breadth. Furthermore, the centroid can be computed
</I>&gt;<i> as the average of all the coordinates in one of those passes too.
</I>&gt;<i> The other family of morphological parameters relates to the labelling of the
</I>&gt;<i> pixels. These include the number of pixels, and all the greyscale statistics
</I>&gt;<i> of the blob (for example via redirection to an image holding the greyscale
</I>&gt;<i> values) and the centre of mass. There is an advantage in computing this whole
</I>&gt;<i> block together too, as the code for computing the mean grey level is already
</I>&gt;<i> almost there to allow computing the standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. One accesses each pixel in the blob only once.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We do have a use case in which pixels are multiply labeled (current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> research has images of objects that cross and share pixels) which means
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the most general case can't use reconstruction of a binary image to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recover the labeling.
</I>&gt;<i> I see, well yes that brings in new issues. Perhaps one could implement a
</I>&gt;<i> cursor that processes binary images and which is very fast, while multi-label
</I>&gt;<i> images require some special treatment?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We might want to keep in mind that it is useful to have both 8- and 4-
</I>&gt;<i> connected particle encodings for the analysis of blobs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for listening!
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i>
