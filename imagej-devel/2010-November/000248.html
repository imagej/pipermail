<PRE>Hi Lee,

Do you mean to: given an XStart YStart, this cursor would go round the blob 
and compute a collection of parameters?
If so, yes it might be a really good idea.

Good. Yes, there is a definite advantage one has all the blobs labelled to be 
able to target each one from a table of positions rather than going all over 
the image. I mentioned StartZ (I realised now that in IJ these are called 
XStart, etc) but currently there is no native method to isolate 3D blobs.

&gt;<i> The outline pixels can be recovered from a list of pixel coordinates for
</I>&gt;<i> each label by sorting the coordinates by x then y and finding the ones
</I>&gt;<i> without y neighbors on either side, and then sorting by y, then x and

</I>&gt;<i> you have a binary thresholding of the image.
</I>
Here is where Freeman's algorithm (walking around each blob) is efficient 
because it gives the boundary already sorted in the sequence along of the 
walk. Currently IJ uses a different algorithm to compute the perimeter length. 
(results for large blobs are similar to Freeman's but if I recall correctly 
there is some discrepancy for small ones). Also IJ uses the number of pixels 
as &quot;area&quot;. While some might not bother too much about this detail, others 
might think differently (me included :-) ). If a pixel is a point, the area 
cannot be 1 and it should have no perimeter and no circularity, etc. Freeman's 
encoding solves this, I think, a bit better and we should try to provide both, 
area inside the bounding perimeter and number of pixels in the blob.

Also one wants that perimeter sorted for a number of other reasons. For 
example one can compute the yardstick fractal dimension using this sorted list 
of coordinates. And one can also use this list and save the blob outlines as a 
chain encoded profile (this is used by some imaging systems). The file size is 
minuscule as it encodes one of the 8 possible positions of the next pixel and 
one can pack several &quot;next positions&quot; per byte).
After going round the profile and one reaches the starting pixel (plus 
checking that the pixel at x-1, y+1 is either visited or empty, if not one 
still has some boundary to walk) one already has the perimeter and the area 
under the enclosed perimeter. So one can compute circularity in one operation.  
The cursor could return the perimeter length and the area enclosed by the 
perimeter. But now that the perimeter has been computer, one can also extract 
the convex hull from the sorted list, and the convex area, and once you have 
the convex hull, the feret diameter is computed easily, and its angle with the 
horizontal frame, and the breadth. Furthermore, the centroid can be computed 
as the average of all the coordinates in one of those passes too.
The other family of morphological parameters relates to the labelling of the 
pixels. These include the number of pixels, and all the greyscale statistics 
of the blob (for example via redirection to an image holding the greyscale 
values) and the centre of mass. There is an advantage in computing this whole 
block together too, as the code for computing the mean grey level is already 
almost there to allow computing the standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, 
etc. One accesses each pixel in the blob only once.

&gt;<i> We do have a use case in which pixels are multiply labeled (current
</I>&gt;<i> research has images of objects that cross and share pixels) which means
</I>&gt;<i> that the most general case can't use reconstruction of a binary image to
</I>&gt;<i> recover the labeling.
</I>
I see, well yes that brings in new issues. Perhaps one could implement a 
cursor that processes binary images and which is very fast, while multi-label 
images require some special treatment?

We might want to keep in mind that it is useful to have both 8- and 4-
connected particle encodings for the analysis of blobs.

Thanks for listening! 
Regards

Gabriel
