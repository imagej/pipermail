<PRE>Hi Albert,

&gt;<i> Thoughts on large files. ImageJ 1 cannot open images larger than the
</I>&gt;<i> maximum signed int value, but there is no reason why ImageJ 2
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be able to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you guys planning for imglib2 on a PlanarCellContainer that
</I>&gt;<i> behaves like a PlanarArrayContainer that has been internally chopped
</I>&gt;<i> up into as many cells as necessary, circumventing the array size
</I>&gt;<i> limit? And given the large size, extra bonus if the file is lazily
</I>&gt;<i> loaded, that is, each cell is loaded on demand from the large file on
</I>&gt;<i> disk.
</I>
I won't pretend to know anything about imglib, but for what it's
worth it is possible to read small tiles from images using Bio-Formats (as you
likely already know).  See this method in IFormatReader:

<A HREF="http://git.openmicroscopy.org/?p=bioformats.git;a=blob;f=components/bio-formats/src/loci/formats/IFormatReader.java#l236">http://git.openmicroscopy.org/?p=bioformats.git;a=blob;f=components/bio-formats/src/loci/formats/IFormatReader.java#l236</A>

Unless the whole image is compressed as a single stream, opening a
small tile will not cause the entire image to be read.

&gt;<i> From some time ago I recall having heard or read that LOCI Bioformats
</I>&gt;<i> can already read ROIs from images in disk. Is that right? If you could
</I>&gt;<i> point me to an example that would b appreciated.
</I>
Bio-Formats can read ROIs stored in some file formats, e.g. Zeiss LSM.
A brand new example of how to work with the parsed ROIs is available here:

<A HREF="http://git.openmicroscopy.org/?p=bioformats.git;a=blob;f=components/bio-formats/utils/PrintROIs.java">http://git.openmicroscopy.org/?p=bioformats.git;a=blob;f=components/bio-formats/utils/PrintROIs.java</A>

See also loci.plugins.util.ROIHandler, which translates ROIs read using
Bio-Formats into ImageJ ROIs:

<A HREF="http://git.openmicroscopy.org/?p=bioformats.git;a=blob;f=components/loci-plugins/src/loci/plugins/util/ROIHandler.java">http://git.openmicroscopy.org/?p=bioformats.git;a=blob;f=components/loci-plugins/src/loci/plugins/util/ROIHandler.java</A>

In writing the example I remembered just how painful it is to work with
ROIs using the current API, so if either of those examples is unclear
please let me know.

Regards,
-Melissa
