I think that what makes the tube look a bit strange is the lower boundary.
I assume that the horizon is somewhere where the focusing knob is so the lower 
end needs to be slightly curved.
Have a look at the attached image. If that border can be made curved instead 
of horizontal I think it would be better.

Sure I understand, and of course I opened my mouth with a constructive intent. 
We want the best imaging program to have the best logo ;-)

Best of luck in your next move!

Cheers
