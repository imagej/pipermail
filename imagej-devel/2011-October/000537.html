Yes, exactly, if you brighten it, it shows that the bottom brass piece of the 
main tube (attached to the revolving piece is oncave (while the logo is 
completely horizontal). And the top one (at the ocular piece should be 
slightly convex.
As it stands it mixes 2 different perspectives in a single object... but... 
thinking about it, Picasso did not do too bad with that approach :-)

Sorry to hear that... Yes, sure the drawing has a lot of work and maybe when 
reduced it is not even noticeable.

Also perhaps with a little of retouching that can be changed to match the 
picture. Are the vector graphics editable and available?

&gt;<i> Perhaps we should do a similar thing for the logo as with the About dialog

</I>&gt;<i> logos, and then the community can vote on the one they like best. What do
</I>&gt;<i> you think?
</I>
Why not!
Cheers
