Hi everyone,

Here is the schedule for ImageJDev meetings through the end of May.

Tuesdays, 10-11am CDT, Rm 274 ? group planning sessions for fleshing out the
project's technical directions.

Thursdays, 3:30-4:30pm CDT, Rm 236 ? rotating informal status reports. Each
week, one of us will present recent work and discuss any open questions.

The tentative schedule is as follows:
Thu 8 Apr, 3:30pm - Rick: progress on OpenCL-based plugins
Tue 13 Apr, 10am - Discuss data model: ij.process, ImageProcessor, imglib
Thu 15 Apr, 3:30pm - Grant: progress on technological recommendations
Tue 20 Apr, 10am - Discuss display: ij.gui, java.awt.geom
Thu 22 Apr, 3:30pm - TBD
Tue 27 Apr, 10am - Discuss I/O: ij.io, Bio-Formats architecture

Thus far, it has worked well for external collaborators to conference in
using Skype. If anyone else external wishes to participate, let us know in
advance and we can make arrangements.

Message-ID: <w2w857a86451004071325yc4bd1fbfm7bc8b3281c9c1cf3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I thought it would be useful to have an ImageJ developers chat room. I have
seen it work well for the Fiji and OME teams, as it helps keep
geographically distributed people in touch, and allows technical chatter
without the immediate interruption of other forms of communication.

One question is: what is the best software to use to host such a room? The
Fiji team uses IRC (freenode.net), whereas the OME team has their own Jabber
server. For the time being, I created a persistent chat room on
conference.jabber.org called imagejdev with password loci, which you are
welcome to join.

You will need a client capable of joining password-protected Jabber chat
rooms (unfortunately, it appears that iChat and the GTalk client do not
support it?please correct me if I am wrong). I use Adium on Mac OS X, and
Pidgin will almost certainly work on Win/Linux.

For Jabber accounts, it should work to use either a Google account (GTalk),
or for UW-Madison folks your wisc.edu address (WiscChat?see
http://www.doit.wisc.edu/wiscchat/).

Hi everyone,

Well, upon further testing, the chat room doesn't seem to be working anyway.
Maybe conference.jabber.org doesn't support users from other servers.
Perhaps it would be easier to switch to IRC like Fiji. Anyone have a
preference?

To explain a bit: Rick set up a Skype-based chat room, which you are all
welcome to join via the above link, to stay connected on the ImageJDev
project. As I said before, it's very handy for discussing technical issues,
and for making announcements to the group without needing to use email.

Hi all,
It appears that the public chat feature isn't available on the Windows 
Skype client - too bad. I think I'm in favor of using the lowest common 
denominator for communication - e-mail to imagej-devel for formal 
correspondence and IRC for informal. I've never done it before, but it 
is possible to set up a conference call using Skype. My Skype account 
for here at the Broad is leek.broadinstitute.org.

We (Adam and I) are going to be attending most meetings remotely, 
including the one this afternoon, so I'm wondering what we can use 
there. I recently used www.gotomeeting.com and that was pretty 
successful. It has audio (via computer or phone-in) and screen sharing 
and can host up to 15 people / meeting. The cost is about $500 / year 
which seems exorbitant when so many other things are free... There is a 
trial available which I'd hope might serve us for this afternoon's meeting.

Hi everyone,

Lee managed to get connected to the Skype room, so it looks like Windows
Skype does support multi-user chat after all.

Regarding the meetings, what has worked well for us so far is to send out
the slides in advance to those attending, and then use a Skype conference
call to follow along with the speaker. We'll see how well it works this
afternoon.

Hi Grant,

The Fluent pattern is pretty neat, but I agree with Fowler's assessment of
the downside:

"One of the problems of methods in a fluent interface is that they don't
make much sense on their own. Looking at a method browser of method by
method documentation doesn't show much sense to with. Indeed sitting there
on its own I'd argue that it's a badly named method that doesn't communicate
its intent at all well. It's only in the context of the fluent action that
it shows its strengths. One way around this may be to use builder objects
that are only used in this context."

I think his idea of using fluent builder objects to ease creation of object
state would make the core classes a lot more readable (since the core
classes themselves would not be cluttered with weird methods like "with").

Hi everyone,

We are going to adjust the weekly Thursday status update meetings from
3:30pm CDT to 2:30pm CDT instead, starting next week (22 April). This change
helps avoid having meetings quite so late in the day.

I was also thinking we might want to reorder which topics we discuss during
upcoming Tuesdays. As discussed at today's meeting, I will send out some
information about ROIs, but as Johannes pointed out the ROI discussion is
not scheduled until 4 May?should we move ROIs up to 20 April instead?

Assuming we don't swap the Tuesday order, the updated schedule is as
follows:

Thu 15 Apr, 3:30pm - Grant: progress on technological recommendation
Tue 20 Apr, 10am - Discuss display: ij.gui, java.awt.geom
Thu 22 Apr, 2:30pm - Brian: progress on FARSIGHT interoperability
Tue 27 Apr, 10am - Discuss I/O: ij.io, Bio-Formats architecture
Thu 29 Apr, 2:30pm - TBD
Tue 4 May, 10am - Discuss ROIs: java.awt.geom, JHotDraw, OME-XML
Thu 6 May, 2:30pm - TBD
Tue 11 May, 10am - Discuss scripting & plugins: Java 6 Scripting Framework
Thu 13 Apr, 2:30pm - TBD
Tue 18 May, 10am - TBD
Thu 20 Apr, 2:30pm - TBD
Tue 25 May, 10am - TBD
Thu 27 Apr, 2:30pm - TBD

As I said, no big problem for me with anything you schedule. I'd just like 
to listen in, and hopefully I will manage to get me a headset... ;-)

I'll try to get some input of the "Europeans" to the ROI issue: the 
Stephans, Albert and Mark. And then I'll just give a summary to you guys 
whenever you schedule the ROI meeting.

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1004142213520.4883@intel-tinevez-2-302>

Hi,

I just tried to come up with a sensible way to ensure that I do not 
violate the coding style of imglib. This is what I came up with (it 
requires version 1.24 of Artistic Style: http://astyle.sourceforge.net/):

astyle --indent=tab --unpad-paren --pad-paren-in --pad=oper --mode=java 
--keep-one-line-blocks --keep-one-line-statements --suffix=none 
--lineend=linux --formatted $(git ls-files \*.java)

Many of the files have CR/LF line endings, so if you want to see what this 
_really_ changes, call:

git diff --ignore-space-at-eol

In any case, don't do that if you have uncommitted changes you want to 
keep!

Ciao,
Johannes

P.S.: if anybody is interested, I can commit the result to a topic branch.

Hi Johannes,

I agree that we should pay attention to the coding style of imglib, ImageJ
and related Fiji projects. My current plan for ImageJ is to use Eclipse,
since it allows you to define source code formatting conventions and apply
them. I believe you can also export the rules as XML so that we can commit
them to the git repository. Eventually we could even have a post-commit hook
to take care of it.

I tried to avoid requiring Eclipse, but I won't fight the tide.

Hi,

while writing a base class for JUnit tests, I realized that I did not 
close() the cursors when cursor.hasNext() returned false. Are you supposed 
to close() them even then?

Hi Johannes,

I completely agree that we should not require Eclipse as an IDE for Fiji or
ImageJ developers. No way, no how. :-)

Rather, my idea was to setup Eclipse on the server for use as a post-commit
hook.

It is possible to invoke certain Eclipse features from the command line,
such as the code formatter:
http://blogs.operationaldynamics.com/andrew/software/java-gnome/eclipse-code-format-from-command-line.html

I have also been looking at Maven and it is capable of running many reports
(e.g., code coverage analysis) as part of its project web site generation.
With a continuous integration system such as Hudson in place, we can
leverage this functionality to provide a lot of feedback to the community on
a regular basis about the health of the project.

Hi Johannes,

At the hackathon Steffi told me it is best practice to always close cursors.
I had not done this in SquareTest so I committed a change that now does so.

Thanks,
Curtis

Hi,

Cursor.hasNext() == false does not mean that the cursor is out of image
bounds and, depending on the container may still point to some data.
Image keeping track of its cursors, it is good to close them for freeing
this data.  Currently, this is important in cell containers only.

I think that the recent design changes regarding data access make this
tracking of cursors obsolete and so Cursor.close() too.  A good hint is
that Image.removeCursor() is just never called.  But I am very tired and
have to check this.

Good night,
Stephan

My misunderstanding came from the name of the hook: a post-commit hook can 
only run locally, not on the server. And I'd actually make that a 
pre-commit hook.

Well, for the moment, I just played it safe. Please check out the 
junit-tests branch (based on master~2, so it will need adjusting once the 
huge changes of containerlevel come in).

I know that I have to add a few comments, but I just spent almost 2 hours 
to hunt down a bug that I introduced in Fiji's javac 3 weeks ago, so I am 
thoroughly tired.

The current version of the tests is here:

http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=imglib.git;a=commitdiff;h=fd8eb4b6a9ad62d4103d36017d9da7ff8f4fedae

The idea is to have a few helper methods in TestBase which can

- construct images algorithmically
- compare images to some calculated values
- compare "signatures", i.e. first and second order moments of intensity 
  and coordinates.

Obviously, I want to avoid large test images in the repository, and I want 
to make it very simple to add tests, because we need them.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi guys,

right now the Cursor.close() call is not necessary for any of the containers. But it will be when we start paging data and each Cursor will get a lock on the cell it currently works on. So when writing stuff using imglib one should think ahead and close cursors when they are not needed anymore. 

I do not really see how the new design should get rid of that paging-lock-cell problem Stephan -  how should it work without explicitly closing the cursor so that it releases the cell it is currently on when not needed anymore...
It might also be that Cursors have a local cache (which might be again an Image) they can empty when they are not needed anymore or that only a certain number of Cursors in parallel is allowed for some reason. 

Ciao ciao,
Steffi

Fair enough. I might try my hand on some static code analyzer to point out 
where a cursor needs to be closed.

As I said---I was tired :)  I thought about not locking cells at all and
delivering a copy of the data for each cursor independently which then
would be deleted automatically on cursor death but that violates data
persistence for many cursors accessing the same data.  So we need an
external instance providing the paged data in a single instance and,
therefore, the close construct.

Deleting the cursor the Java way would delete the Cache too, Caches on
container- or image-level would need the close construct though.  For
constraining the number of cursors allowed to run in parallel, I cannot
figure out a proper reason.

Still, Image collects the cursors working on it but never removes them,
this needs to be fixed.

Stephan

As Steffi said, currently not at all, but for potentially paging
containers to come, always.  In any case, on deletion of the
container/image itself, the cursor-external references to the access
pages are gone.  That is, when you close the image/container, you do not
have to close the cursors working on it before nulling them.  Otherwise
always.

Best,
Stephan

That makes perfect sense but would not support writing data to the container, just to the copy of the Type ... this is fine for a read-only container like the ShapeList but not for "normal" images I would say ...

> Deleting the cursor the Java way would delete the Cache too, Caches on

But not if it is some kind of data lying on the harddisk ... or if it might use write-caching (maybe writing to a web-resource in blocks rather than single operations)

Maybe only one cursor at a time is allowed to be fast and not need synchronization? Or for the write-cache ...

I guess my point is, a cursor.close() does not really harm and but most importantly does not limit anything what can be programmed with. We need it for images and containers anyways and it is somehow consistent in that way. 

And it makes the code more structured IMHO, it is clearer where the validity of a cursor ends...

I completely agree on that one, this needs fixing! I had it initially to be able to close all cursors of an image for paged cells...

Ciao ciao, Steffi

Oops, my experience comes mainly from SVN, where a "post-commit hook" runs
on the server after someone commits. But regardless, I suppose a script that
cleans up the source code formatting would need to happen pre-commit rather
than afterward.

With git, I am not sure how that would work. Perhaps I could configure the
continuous integration server to do nightly source code formatting or some
such? Might result in various "spammy" commits, though.

Well, the problem there is that they might not fast-forward, and besides, 
I would like to be able to do it manually, just to make sure. That's why I 
was doubtful of Eclipse, because with Git, the hook _must_ run locally.

For those looking to get started learning imglib, here are a few resources.

1) You can clone the imglib code from the git repository:
git clone git://imagejdev.org/imglib.git

2) The authors have written a nice introductory guide, available in the doc
subdirectory, or online at:
http://imagejdev.org/trac/imglib/browser/doc/The%20Generic%20Java%20Image%20Processing%20Library.pdf

It is a little out of date now, but still provides a good overview of the
library.

3) There is some good information on the Fiji wiki at:
http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/wiki/index.php/Imglib

See also the "Tutorials & Howtos" linked at the bottom.

4) In Fiji, you can invoke the Script Editor with File > New > Script. Then
load a template for creating an imglib plugin with Templates > Imglib
Plugin.

5) Somewhat tangentially, I wrote an "Imglib Algorithm Launcher" (available
in the algorithm-launcher branch of fiji):
http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git;a=commit;h=246bc9a9c8b19d7b0ee1bce2ffa394ca919abce2

6) Questions can be directed to the fiji-devel mailing list at:
http://groups.google.com/group/fiji-devel

Hi everyone,

One other thing I forgot to mention: I wrote a tiny example called
SquareTest that squares an image. You can find it in the tests subdirectory
of imglib, or online at:
http://imagejdev.org/trac/imglib/browser/tests/SquareTest.java

Hi everybody,

the massive changes Saalfeld and me did during the Hackathon are now
officially pushed to master. Most of the changes are not visible, only the
new hierarchy of numeric values:

NumericType <- ComplexType <- RealType <- IntegerType

Typically you can make your stuff running again by changing NumericType to
RealType...
and
OutsideStrategy is now OutOfBoundsStrategy
And
CubeContainer is now CellContainer

I just want to comment on the idea behind it, for that I attach a document
that shows my Skype discussion with Albert for now who had to adapt his code
for the new structure ... I think that conversation was not so bad as Albert
points out at the end :)

Have fun,
Stephan & Stephan

[4/13/2010 3:41:52 AM] Stephan Preibisch: hi albert
[4/13/2010 3:42:09 AM] Stephan Preibisch: this is the new numeric type
structure we did in heidelberg
[4/13/2010 3:42:13 AM] Albert Cardona: sure
[4/13/2010 3:42:17 AM] Albert Cardona: and how is it used?
[4/13/2010 3:42:29 AM] Stephan Preibisch: NumericType <- ComplexType <-

[4/13/2010 3:42:31 AM] Albert Cardona: is it documented somewhere? I need to

[4/13/2010 3:45:47 AM] Albert Cardona: so RealType doesn't have a getReal()
now?

distinguish
[4/13/2010 3:46:45 AM] Stephan Preibisch: for setting it works without

[4/13/2010 3:47:01 AM] Stephan Preibisch: we did not want to enforce to
having to compute with Doubles

[4/13/2010 3:47:12 AM] Albert Cardona: so long
[4/13/2010 3:47:15 AM] Albert Cardona: and redundant
[4/13/2010 3:47:17 AM] Stephan Preibisch: no
[4/13/2010 3:47:22 AM] Albert Cardona: a Float is a Real, so why
getRealFloat?
[4/13/2010 3:47:34 AM] Stephan Preibisch: because there is also a
getRealComplex()
[4/13/2010 3:47:39 AM] Albert Cardona: is like saying getRealFloatNumber
[4/13/2010 3:47:45 AM] Stephan Preibisch: getComplexFloat()
[4/13/2010 3:47:52 AM] Stephan Preibisch: getRealFloat()
[4/13/2010 3:47:55 AM] Albert Cardona: uf
[4/13/2010 3:48:05 AM] Albert Cardona: very verbose, but whatever
[4/13/2010 3:48:11 AM] Albert Cardona: is not like I can change it
[4/13/2010 3:48:30 AM] Stephan Preibisch: but getFloat() is not clear
[4/13/2010 3:48:40 AM] Stephan Preibisch: if it is the complex or the real
part
[4/13/2010 3:49:29 AM] Albert Cardona: getComplexFloat returns what?
[4/13/2010 3:49:33 AM] Albert Cardona: a Complex number?
[4/13/2010 3:49:37 AM] Albert Cardona: or just the complex part of the
float?
[4/13/2010 3:50:05 AM] Stephan Preibisch: the idea is ( how it really is )
[4/13/2010 3:50:18 AM] Stephan Preibisch: a real number is also a complex
number
[4/13/2010 3:50:22 AM] Stephan Preibisch: a subset of it
[4/13/2010 3:50:29 AM] Albert Cardona: hum yes
[4/13/2010 3:50:29 AM] Albert Cardona: true
[4/13/2010 3:50:31 AM] Stephan Preibisch: RealType extends ComplexType
[4/13/2010 3:50:51 AM] Albert Cardona: so getComplexFloat returns 0 for just
real numbers.
[4/13/2010 3:51:02 AM] Stephan Preibisch: exactly
[4/13/2010 3:51:02 AM] Albert Cardona: i..e the complex part is o * i
[4/13/2010 3:51:06 AM] Stephan Preibisch: yes
[4/13/2010 3:51:09 AM] Albert Cardona: ok
[4/13/2010 3:51:12 AM] Albert Cardona: got ti
[4/13/2010 3:51:20 AM] Stephan Preibisch: and the math you write for complex
stuff is still correct and works
[4/13/2010 3:51:29 AM] Albert Cardona: xD
[4/13/2010 3:51:35 AM] Albert Cardona: generic image library indeed.
[4/13/2010 3:51:46 AM] Stephan Preibisch: so math for complex numbers should
work on real numbers
[4/13/2010 3:51:50 AM] Stephan Preibisch: and it does
[4/13/2010 3:52:04 AM] Stephan Preibisch: it is just a specialization
[4/13/2010 3:52:15 AM] Stephan Preibisch: and integerType is even more
specialized
[4/13/2010 3:52:38 AM] Stephan Preibisch: but you can still treat it like a
real type
[4/13/2010 3:52:55 AM] Stephan Preibisch: it will just not be stored with
high precision
[4/13/2010 3:53:06 AM] Albert Cardona: woah
[4/13/2010 3:53:13 AM] Albert Cardona: be sure to document all that :)
[4/13/2010 3:53:18 AM] Albert Cardona: it's good, but it's also a gotcha
[4/13/2010 3:53:31 AM] Stephan Preibisch: by that, a gaussian convolution
for example is written for RealType
[4/13/2010 3:53:51 AM] Stephan Preibisch: and works on Integer Types as
well, computing with Doubles internally but saving as ints
[4/13/2010 3:55:00 AM] Stephan Preibisch: but there is still some
documentation needed indeed 
[4/13/2010 3:55:49 AM] Albert Cardona: lots of :)
[4/13/2010 3:55:56 AM] Albert Cardona: the above explanations were very
clear Stephan
[4/13/2010 3:56:00 AM] Albert Cardona: just copy paste them to the wiki :)

It might be pointed out that the FloatType is now in the package 
mpicbg.imglib.type.numeric.real instead.

I pushed a merge and fixup commit to junit-tests. Could you have a look to 
make sure that I did not do anything wrong?

Hi,

I discussed some issues with Steffi, and one of the outcomes is: we 
definitely need a saner directory layout. So the idea is to have

	imglib/ (packages mpicbg.imglib.*)
	tests/ (package mpicbg.imglib.test)
	imglib-algo/ (packages mpicbg.imglib.algorithm.*)

These will directly correspond to imglib.jar, tests.jar and 
imglib-algo.jar.

Any objections?

We have a tentative date of next Thursday in mind, by which time most of 
the topic-branch stuff should be reviewed enough to be merged into master 
by one of the Stephans.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi,

the splitting is fine with me but I would prefer a slightly more
consistent naming scheme (learning from bad example OpenCV):

core -> imglib-core.jar
test -> imglib-test.jar
algorithm -> imglib-algorithm.jar

Best,
Stephan

Makes sense. And for consistency, the corresponding directory names 
'imglib-core', 'imglib-test' and 'imglib-algorithm', yes?

Hi everyone,

As I mentioned recently, I would like to use Maven for structuring projects,
modules and dependencies for ImageJ. Ideally, this would include imglib as
well. I like the breakdown of core vs. algorithm, and of course tests are
separate. And I know Johannes also mentioned potentially having
bsd-algorithms vs. gpl-algorithms, which also makes sense if needed.

Unfortunately, I will not have time to pursue a Maven-based directory
structure and build process until late next week or the week after, due to
some other outstanding development commitments.

Hence, however you guys want to reorganize the imglib project for now is
fine, but be warned that I plan to rock the boat later with a maven branch
illustrating what I'm thinking. ;-)

I thought that the directories are in a directory called imglib already,
so no need to duplicate that... but who cares.

A short note: the cursor class could have an @Override on the
finalize() method from class Object, and in it call .close().

An object's finalize() method is called when garbage-collected. IIRC,
when an object created within a method is no longer referenced (i.e.
the method returned), its finalize() method is called.

If calling close() twice doesn't hurt, then adding it in there would
prevent future errors by programmers new to imglib (and provide a bit
of a safety net).

Of course documenting the need of calling .close() makes sense.

The standard way of iterating an image from imglib with a Cursor should be:

final Cursor c;

try {
    c = ....
    while (c.hasNext()) {
        ...
    }
} finally {
    c.close();
}


In the upcoming Java 7, there's "Automatic Resource Management", which
is nothing other than an automatic call to "close()" on a Reader
interface (and hopefully other interfaces). In any case this is far in
the future for Fiji.

Might be a bad idea:

	http://www.javafaq.nu/java-article259.html

In short: implementing finalize() can impose a significant slow-down on 
the garbage collector.

Message-ID: <6C69139A-AA48-41C4-9BB9-E52E10B45567@lifesci.dundee.ac.uk>

[Apologies for the cross-post, but it seemed necessary, and various  
people said it was ok]

Dear All-

There have been various discussions about modeling of ROIs for our  
respective projects.  OME is currently using a 5D (space, time,  
channel) ROI spec, which is available here:

http://www.ome-xml.org/wiki/ROI

This matches the existing spec we use for images as 5D objects.  Its  
works for most conventional images.

However, we're all fully aware that this doesn't cut it for some very  
important use cases.  One we are working on right now-- FLIM.  There  
are obviously many others.  In OME parlance, this is the N-dimensional  
problem:

http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/wiki/WorkPlan/NDimensionalData

The Data Modeling work (such as it is) on this is at:

http://www.ome-xml.org/ticket/112

Whatever we do, we'd much prefer to be in synch with concepts within  
Fiji, as we will continue to release bridges between OMERO and Fiji,  
and doubtless, in good time, will need to include support for ROIs in  
Bio-Formats.

Stimulated by a presentation from Curtis Rueden last week, I started  
an email thread with Dan White on this topic over the weekend, and it  
seems this discussion should be out in the open.  Anyone interested in  
trying to work out an alignment on this topic?  If so, are there Fiji  
resources we can stare at and see what you all are thinking?

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

Jason

ImageJ 1.0 and earlier was small and simple, and had the
extraordinarily valuable quality that it worked. It was immediately
used in production. Biological researchers applied it for their image
processing needs. Their feedback fueled the growth of ImageJ over the
next decade.

I suggest you build a small application that uses imglib/ImageJ2.0
features rather than a mock up. Effort-wise, it may be about the same.

Best,

Albert

Hi Albert,

Thanks for your comments. To be clear, something like EasyMock would be for
the unit tests, not for use in ImageJ core itself. The unit tests are mainly
a solid way to help avoid regression bugs as the code evolves.

Fantastic!

Seriously, I think the name is pretty great. Googling around, I couldn't

How about "ed8ae538-44c4-4303-8e07-943a45c9cb58" ?
It's unique too - and language-agnostic. Call it "ed" for short.

Hm...  not quite, unfortunately. If you look at the link, you will realise 
that it is not imjlib, but im/lib. This seems to be mis-read character by some 
OCR? :-/

That's even better actually.  My point was just that the top Google hit 
is completely obscure, unlike the "American R&B boy band" I'm getting 
for imajin.

It's nice that y'all have your fun suggesting names, just as we did at the 
hackathon.

But last time I checked, it was considered the honor of the parents to 
name their baby.

Oh, yes, I see what you mean. I thought the point you were making was an 
additional connection to some ancient name rather than its uniqueness.

I would suggest a few changes:

- do not make a common interface for interactive extensions (otherwise, 
  why is there no common interface for non-interactive extensions? 
  besides, what would that common interactive interface contain?)

- the interactive plugin should always just hand off to the 
  non-interactive version of the plugin. If you do not require such a 
  bonding, you will end up with non-recordable actions (or at least with 
  the same problems with headless mode as we have right now)

- do not special-case the stack processor. If you do that, you inherently 
  restrict the Processor to 2 dimensions and you get the whole problem set 
  of ImageProcessor vs ImagePlus vs ImageStack again. A processor should 
  process images, whatever image you throw at it. It _may_ throw an 
  exception (or indicate otherwise what it supports), but the extension 
  interface is not the level at which you want to discern whether it 
  handles 2D or >=3D.

- do not couple the processor with the algorithm that strictly. It should 
  be a 0..n connection. Algorithms offer a flexible Java-based API, while 
  the extension should make it possible for application frameworks to 
  discover user-specifiable parameters (sort of "AUI" -- application 
  users' interface), so they are a different kettle than the extensions.

>From the list I sent to the Skype "channel", your diagram is only missing 
the way to specify menu entries. I really would try to decouple the menu 
entry specification from the actual action behind it, so the menu 
extensions would not be processors.

Johannes

Who says -- in these modern times -- that the parents need to have 
different genders?

Actually, it was sorted out by default: Albert did not like the title 
"father of Fiji", but his answer stuck.

Hi Grant & Johannes,

Thanks for this discussion. Grant, to generalize Johannes's comment about
the Interactive interface, I am wondering about further detail for each
item. From the names alone I am having a hard time understanding the role of
some of them. I know this diagram is just a sketch, but I look forward to
seeing more detail in each box?short description of the function/purpose,
list of key fields & methods, etc.

-Curtis

Here's my tentative slide deck for the presentation. I'll spend about 
1/2 of the time going over the slide and 1/2 on a quick demo of 
CellProfiler - hoping we can do something that lets people see that 
remotely.

Hello All,

We will have several meetings this week. There is one today at 10am in room 274 about I/O. Both Lee and Adam from the Cell Profiler project will be there in person.

On Wed (tomorrow) at 2pm Lee and Adam will be presenting their project in room 236. 

This Thursday at 3:30pm we will have a meeting with Jason Swedlow in room 236 for him to meet everyone and informally discuss OME and ImageJ. 

Because of this we will delay Aivar's presentation to next week. Barry will be the week after. 

There will be no meetings on Friday.

best,
kevin
