After much research and experimentation, I believe I have fixed this bug:
    https://github.com/imagej/imagej/commit/66b4e29e

I also made several other improvements to ImageJ2's base directory
detection:
    https://github.com/imagej/imagej/compare/66b4e29ede81...ca49a734d5cc

Using the latest ij-core-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in place of KNIP's bundled
ij-core-2.0.0-beta4.jar, the problem is fixed on my system, and the ImageJ2
nodes appear as expected now.

Please let me know if you have any other issues.

Regards,
Curtis

P.S. Special thanks to Christian for helping me set up my KNIME+KNIP
development environment!

I will have to test this again in the Fiji context. It will most likely
fail since there is no imagej.Main in the class path. I am not sure that
the stack trace will contain a valid main class as top-level entry.

My apologies, it was my mistake to omit an explanation why my fix was
necessary (to keep the Fiji updater running okay).

Hi Curtis,

I updated to the snapshot-core.jar and it works now as intended. We will 
release an updated (ImageJ4 beta compatible) version of the ImageJ 
plugin in the next few weeks together with the next minor release of the 
Knime Image Extension.

Thank you for your efforts
Regards Michael

Hi Justin,

Thanks for your reply, and sorry for the delay in my response.

Interesting. Did you see this project: http://code.google.com/p/sdf4j/

It might be worthwhile to create an ImageJ2 SDF4J UI that would be
compatible with both AWT-based JVMs and Android (since those are the two
existing implementations so far).

Also, are you talking about ImageJ 1.x, or ImageJ2? With ImageJ2, no AWT
wrappers should be necessary; rather, you can implement a different UI
using the Android UI classes (or perhaps even SDF4J, mentioned above).




They are very similar, but some incompatibilities makes totally as-is

I am interested to hear why ImgLib on Android is impossible. Are there
changes we can make to the library to fix that? If so, we should do it
sooner rather than later. The longer we wait to make architectural or API
changes to the code, the more difficult it will become, due to increasing
usage in the wild. And once ImgLib2 and ImageJ2 come out of beta we will be
committed to maintaining backwards API compatibility, which complicates
things.

Definitely, I would be happy to help. You should certainly not have to
un-Mavenize these projects. On the contrary, the M2E plugin is supposed to
make dependency management in Eclipse better and more powerful. There are
two ways of doing it: 1) import the actual Maven projects (in which case
you can debug into and even change the source code on the fly), or 2)
right-click the Maven JAR dependency and select "Maven > Download Sources"
to download and link a source code JAR (in which case you can debug into,
but not change, the linked source code).

I have not done a lot of research, but some basic searches yield e.g. many
YouTube videos talking about cross-platform mobile development using HTML5.
>From a cursory inspection, it looks quite doable, though there are surely
many pitfalls (e.g., no position:fixed on iOS 4!).


One video I saw (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij5YWGiGSMU#t=16m39s) goes
into a fair amount of detail discussing cross-platform mobile HTML5
development, and comparison to native apps. But that video is already
almost two years old, and given how fast HTML5 is growing, it's hard to say
what the current state of affairs is without more extensive research and
experimentation.


In any case, I'm looking forward to hearing your talk at the conference.
Hopefully we will have time to hack on some code. Note that I will be in
Luxembourg until Sunday the 28th, to discuss and work on projects a little
afterward.


Regards,

Curtis

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] BioImaging ROI Spec
Message-ID: <CC989962.15809%j.r.swedlow@dundee.ac.uk>

Dear All-

I'm writing following various discussions  regarding the definition and use of a common specification for multi-dimensional regions for biological imaging, and in particular biological microscopy.  I am cc'ing Michael Unser, Wiro Niessen and Antje Keppler on this email for reasons that I will describe below.  I've also included representation from OME, ImageJDev, KNIME, Icy, and CellProfiler.

The first concrete discussion on a common ROI spec was held in April in Barcelona.  Josh Moore's notes were circulated earlier (also, see below).

We now have an opportunity to finish this specification.  This follows from meetings sponsored by Euro-BioImaging (http://eurobioimaging.eu), and in particular The Data Management Work Package (often referred to as "WP11"), led by Wiro and Michael, and which I, through our work on OME, contribute to.  Through WP11, we have funds to sponsor a meeting that moves a common ROI spec towards completion.  The idea is to have a common specification, and example "proof-of-concept" software implementation(s) in at least a few of our projects, so that a region defined in one image software package can be used by another.  The emphasis is on transport and interop, and not, for example, on a single library for defining, using ROIs that must be used by all.  We already know the kind and level of standardization that works, and that which does not.

Given the progress we made in Barcelona, it seems that this is not a fantasy, but an achievable goal.  We don't propose a standard meeting with presentations, etc., but more of a developer meeting or "hackathon", that has been so successfully used by the ImageJ/Fiji teams and others.  We need to work through the specification (ideally making some progress beforehand using the various electronic tools we all know and love), and then get at least rough implementations in place.

As a start, we've used the scijava.org site that was defined at the Dresden ImageJ/Fiji hackathon in Dec 2011.  See:

http://www.scijava.org/

As this was where our projects agreed to work together at the Dresden hackathon, it seemed a place where we could do this work, but this is not at all mandatory? just a place to start.  Whatever we use, it has to be usable for modern code development (in my opinion, that means, it has to be github or better, but other opinions welcome).  Obviously other resources can link to this.

Below ?Resources?, there is now a link to:

http://www.scijava.org/roi-model/

On this page are Josh Moore's notes from the Barcelona mtg.  With Lee Kamentsky's permission we can add his SpaceROI.xsd (email from 30 April), or a more recent update to it.  Roger Leigh (OME) has added his work on a draft model spec.  He can explain what is going on there.

For the mtg itself, we propose two possible dates? Nov 12-14 or Dec 10-12.  There are obviously several looming conflicts? US Thanksgiving, ASCB in SF, and several others.  I believe there is also an ImageJ hackathon looming.  So far there is strong preference for the November date.  Obviously minimising trans-ocean flights helps productivity and keeps us all in good graces with our families.  Wilma Woudenberg will send out a poll and we can try to get this nailed down.  If those dates don't work, we can go sooner or later, so speak up, but would be great to get this done before end of 2012.

For location, we've discussed Dresden, Dundee, and there may be others.  Through Euro-BioImaging, Dundee has funds to sponsor the meeting, and to support travel for participants (economy only).  If possible, Dundee will do all travel arrangements, to save the fun of travel reimbursements from EU grants.

I wasn't exactly sure who was interested, and we don't yet have a single mailing list that covers all of us, although the SciJava google group (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scijava) has been used for some  discussions.    This problem will get worse when we need our various developers to talk to each other.  I know many of the OME devs read the ImageJdev list, but that is not universal.  Note that some of the email lists included require registration, so do we use scijava at googlegroups?

Ok, this a too long email.  Decisions needed:

-- do we agree to use scijava to start this discussion?
-- can we put materials, discussions we each have there?
-- date for meeting?is there another scheduled event we should piggyback on? (Note I think things like the ImageJ mtg are not a good idea; too many other things going on)
-- everyone OK with Dundee for mtg place??

Note: I'm partial to Dundee, since we have to pay for everything, so it saves admin hassle, but if this can be solved easily, then that's fine.  Wilma will take care of Doodle polls and very likely travel.

We've worked together well in the past, so hopefully we can get this done, and build something that will truly help our scientist users.

Cheers,

Jason

P.S. As Euro-BioImaging will sponsor meeting, the various leaders of WP11 and also Antje Keppler, Euro-BioImaging PM are cc'd.

Dear Jason:

Thanks for this initiative. 
Ricard Delgado, who developed a very nice active contour segmentation software which relies a lot on ROI (cf. my talk at Bioimage informatics in Dresden), is ready to participate as a representative of my lab.
He is available at the proposed date.

Best,
-Michael

Through WP11, we have funds to sponsor a meeting that moves a common ROI spec towards completion.

We already know the kind and level of standardization that works, and that which does not.

Hi Jason,

Thanks for the thorough summary.

> -- do we agree to use scijava to start this discussion?

Yes, I agree that the scijava mailing list is the best place for further
discussion:
    https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scijava

> -- can we put materials, discussions we each have there?

Indeed, though I think technical materials should go into the
@scijava/roi-model repository:
    https://github.com/scijava/roi-model

We can add anyone interested in contributing to the committers list. (Or
you can fork it and submit a PR; either way.)

Figuring out how to organize everything might be a bit tricky, though.

Well, the ImageJ conference (Oct 24-26) is the only time I will be in the
EU otherwise. So no, there is no other meeting that would be convenient for
me personally to piggyback on.

> -- everyone OK with Dundee for mtg place??

Dundee is OK with me, as far as the EU goes. That said, I was recently
lamenting how (with respect to international flights) all of our groups are
based in smaller cities off the proverbial beaten path: Dundee, Dresden,
Madison, Konstanz... But Paris (Pasteur) & Boston (Broad/CellProfiler) are
also represented here! Maybe the big city folks want to organize one of
these shindigs in the future?

Regards,
Curtis

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Code snippet verification script
Message-ID: <CADN69yk9z+Kf8=8T2Prw3-oquYuc7zdSRtD75OoO0J+diC1GLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I completed an initial version of a web code snippet verification script.
It can be found in the SciJava common repository at:

https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/blob/master/bin/verify-code-snippets.pl

The initial use case was to verify that code snippets from the ImgLib2
examples page (http://fiji.sc/ImgLib2_Examples) stay in sync with code in
the Git repository (
https://github.com/imagej/imglib/tree/master/imglib2/examples/src/main/java
).

The script works by looking for a link to code on GitHub (of the form "
https://github.com/.../blob/...") preceding each code snippet.

It is working well for the ImgLib2 Examples, so I have set up a Jenkins job
to run it daily:
    http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-ImgLib-code-snippets/

Later, I will update the various code snippets on developer.imagej.net as
well and add them to the Jenkins job.

Regards,
Curtis

P.S. to Tobias: The script caught your recent changes to Examples 4 & 6. I
updated the wiki page to match!

Cool idea.
Thanks a lot Curtis for fixing the Examples! I hadn't thought about 
updating the wiki...

I'll update the http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/ImgLib2_Documentation
pages with github links as well.

best regards,
Tobias

Hi Curtis,

this is a great idea!! Is there maybe a way I could get an email when the code on the wiki page is updated, it could potentially mean that the code is not in sync with the documentation text I wrote anymore. 

Bye bye,
Stephan

Hi Steffi,

the Wiki offers a recent-change feed:

http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&feed=rss

Don't be old-school and subscribe it in your hopefully feed-capable
e-mail client (otherwise install the required plugin ;)).  The result
would be exactly as desired, you get a `message' when something was
changed.  Beautiful and extremely useful---and without the need to send
e-mails around.

Cheers,
Stephan

Dear Jason,

As I mentioned in my previous answer, we are willing to participate to this initiative. Fabrice and St?phane, the two main developers of Icy, will represent my lab. For the dates, November is fine, but not December.

Best regards,

Jean-Christophe

Through WP11, we have funds to sponsor a meeting that moves a common ROI spec towards completion.  The idea is to have a common specification, and example "proof-of-concept" software implementation(s) in at least a few of our projects, so that a region defined in one image software package can be used by another.  The emphasis is on transport and interop, and not, for example, on a single library for defining, using ROIs that must be used by all.  We already know the kind and level of standardization that works, and that which does not.

Hi Tobias,

Great. It should work if you model it after the ImgLib2 Tutorials page. Of
course, you'll need all your code snippets committed to the Git repository
somewhere too.

Once you have things set, you can check things manually by running (e.g.):

DEBUG=1 $SCIJAVA_COMMON/bin/verify-code-snippets.pl
http://fiji.sc/ImgLib2_-_Getting_Started

Where $SCIJAVA_COMMON is the location of a scijava-common working copy from:
    https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common

Once the verification script is happy with any updated wiki pages, let me
know and I'll add those pages to the Jenkins job. Or if you find a bug, let
me know that too. :-)

Thanks,
Curtis

In addition to Stephan's suggestion, the purpose of that Jenkins job is to
tell us of exactly such a situation. The mail will currently go out to the
ImageJ-builds mailing list. Those of us who monitor it can forward any
breakages to the relevant person (or just fix it ourselves if the solution
is obvious).

Curtis

Hi Jason,

Sorry that this comes rather late. I have been swamped with many unrelated activities and this email thread is arguably long ;-).

The discussion on ROIs started in Barcelona was a good one. This is clearly a crucial feature to allow interoperability between our various platforms. By sitting as a passive observer on the day long discussion, I had a feeling that it is highly technical and I personally cannot contribute much to it. It needs the people in the know to sit down together and hammer it out. Thus a hackathon on this topic is indeed a good idea, the 'politics' of this has been worked out at the various meetings, it now needs someone who can actually do it.

I will support the participation of Tobias and/or Stephan. Dundee is a great location, we cannot do it in Dresden this time. I vote for Dundee.

As for times, Stephan and Tobias will need to say when they could participate. They have a lot on their plate, I cc'ed them explicitly to my response so that they can speak up on this issue.

Thanks for supporting and organizing this.

All the best

PAvel

Hi All,

Of course I would like to participate in this Hackathon.
Dundee is fine with me and at the moment I would be free for both of the 
proposed dates Nov 12-14 and Dec 10-12.

best regards,
Tobias

Hi all,

thanks for moving on with the topic.  I would love to join a hackathon
in Dundee, however, Nov 12-14 would not work for me.  Dec 10-12 is fine.

Best regards,
Stephan

I'm pretty sure I'll go to the meeting - both sets of dates are OK for 
me. I'll check in again when the plans become final and make the 
necessary arrangements. I think it would be useful if we could have some 
sort of scratchpad or wiki to discuss the spec prior to going. I have 
one or two use-cases that are challenging and also I want to plan how to 
address scalability issues and possibly benchmark a couple of approaches 
on real data.

Thanks for getting us organized, Jason.  I want to confirm that the
CellProfiler team is supportive and Lee will represent us.

And yes, we would be very happy to provide meeting space in Boston -
we would love to have the group here for future events.

Hi everybody,

I would really like to participate as well. But I could unfortunately only make it 10-12 December.

Thanks a lot for organizing this Hackathon Jason!

Hope to see you soon,

Dear All-

Thanks very much for the responses, and the interest and commitment to this effort.  Yes, it's boring infrastructure, but it's also important and will deliver value to our scientists users.

Let me do some schedule checking and then get back to you all on final dates.  Will be in touch soon.

Cheers,

Jason

Dear All-

I'm writing following various discussions  regarding the definition and use of a common specification for multi-dimensional regions for biological imaging, and in particular biological microscopy.  I am cc'ing Michael Unser, Wiro Niessen and Antje Keppler on this email for reasons that I will describe below.  I've also included representation from OME, ImageJDev, KNIME, Icy, and CellProfiler.

The first concrete discussion on a common ROI spec was held in April in Barcelona.  Josh Moore's notes were circulated earlier (also, see below).

We now have an opportunity to finish this specification.  This follows from meetings sponsored by Euro-BioImaging (http://eurobioimaging.eu), and in particular The Data Management Work Package (often referred to as "WP11"), led by Wiro and Michael, and which I, through our work on OME, contribute to.  Through WP11, we have funds to sponsor a meeting that moves a common ROI spec towards completion.  The idea is to have a common specification, and example "proof-of-concept" software implementation(s) in at least a few of our projects, so that a region defined in one image software package can be used by another.  The emphasis is on transport and interop, and not, for example, on a single library for defining, using ROIs that must be used by all.  We already know the kind and level of standardization that works, and that which does not.

Given the progress we made in Barcelona, it seems that this is not a fantasy, but an achievable goal.  We don't propose a standard meeting with presentations, etc., but more of a developer meeting or "hackathon", that has been so successfully used by the ImageJ/Fiji teams and others.  We need to work through the specification (ideally making some progress beforehand using the various electronic tools we all know and love), and then get at least rough implementations in place.

As a start, we've used the scijava.org<http://scijava.org> site that was defined at the Dresden ImageJ/Fiji hackathon in Dec 2011.  See:

http://www.scijava.org/

As this was where our projects agreed to work together at the Dresden hackathon, it seemed a place where we could do this work, but this is not at all mandatory? just a place to start.  Whatever we use, it has to be usable for modern code development (in my opinion, that means, it has to be github or better, but other opinions welcome).  Obviously other resources can link to this.

Below ?Resources?, there is now a link to:

http://www.scijava.org/roi-model/

On this page are Josh Moore's notes from the Barcelona mtg.  With Lee Kamentsky's permission we can add his SpaceROI.xsd (email from 30 April), or a more recent update to it.  Roger Leigh (OME) has added his work on a draft model spec.  He can explain what is going on there.

For the mtg itself, we propose two possible dates? Nov 12-14 or Dec 10-12.  There are obviously several looming conflicts? US Thanksgiving, ASCB in SF, and several others.  I believe there is also an ImageJ hackathon looming.  So far there is strong preference for the November date.  Obviously minimising trans-ocean flights helps productivity and keeps us all in good graces with our families.  Wilma Woudenberg will send out a poll and we can try to get this nailed down.  If those dates don't work, we can go sooner or later, so speak up, but would be great to get this done before end of 2012.

For location, we've discussed Dresden, Dundee, and there may be others.  Through Euro-BioImaging, Dundee has funds to sponsor the meeting, and to support travel for participants (economy only).  If possible, Dundee will do all travel arrangements, to save the fun of travel reimbursements from EU grants.

I wasn't exactly sure who was interested, and we don't yet have a single mailing list that covers all of us, although the SciJava google group (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scijava) has been used for some  discussions.    This problem will get worse when we need our various developers to talk to each other.  I know many of the OME devs read the ImageJdev list, but that is not universal.  Note that some of the email lists included require registration, so do we use scijava at googlegroups?

Ok, this a too long email.  Decisions needed:

-- do we agree to use scijava to start this discussion?
-- can we put materials, discussions we each have there?
-- date for meeting?is there another scheduled event we should piggyback on? (Note I think things like the ImageJ mtg are not a good idea; too many other things going on)
-- everyone OK with Dundee for mtg place??

Note: I'm partial to Dundee, since we have to pay for everything, so it saves admin hassle, but if this can be solved easily, then that's fine.  Wilma will take care of Doodle polls and very likely travel.

We've worked together well in the past, so hopefully we can get this done, and build something that will truly help our scientist users.

Jason

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] [ImgLib2] PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE USING VIEWS -
 Change of Views.translate() sign

Hi all,

I just made a change to the Views.translate() function. It does now 
exactly the opposite of what it was doing before...

This will break your code if you use Views.translate(), and I apologize 
very much for the inconvenience. An explanation of why this was 
necessary is below, but if you just want to fix your code quickly:

   Simply replace all Views.translate() occurrences in your code by
   Views.offset().

Ok, so why was this done:
Until now, the translation vector t in Views.translate( source, tacted 
on the target coordinates, not the source coordinates. This is
counter-intuitive and inconsistent with the rest of Views. In
particular, if you have a RealView.affine( source, T ) with the affine
transform [0 t] this would have the behaviour of Views.translate(
source, -t).

This was pointed out by Albert Cardona a long time ago (see emails 
quoted below) and I've been putting it off ever since.  Now I wanted
to fix it before the ImageJ Conference, so that we can present a sane
Views.translate() version it the ImgLib tutorials there...

Again, sorry for the inconvenience.
best regards,
Tobias

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Tutorial problems
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1210201215080.2695@bonsai2>

Hi all,

while playing around with ImgLib2, I realized that the imagej-tutorials do
not work anymore. If you try to load and display a dataset, it gets loaded
but not displayed.

Now, I do not want to be a lame developer who just fires bug reports and
forgets about them, so I investigated a little. The culprit seems to be
the changes in the way UserInterfaces are instantiated. Earlier -- when
the tutorial was written -- there was only one UserInterface and if you
did not call createUI() on it (to show the main window) it still was able
to show images with said UserInterface.

In the meantime, we can show multiple user interfaces side by side, but
that comes at a price: when looking for user interfaces to display images,
the default one might not even be visible, resulting in -- nothing.

I have a proposed fix on the 'tutorials' branch, where getVisibleUIs()
falls back to the default UI if none was shown, but I have a hunch that we
need a better solution where the default UI is the only visible UI in the
beginning but as soon as createUI() has been called, the default UI is no
longer being considered automatically visible.

Hmm?

Ciao,
Dscho

P.S.: there is a nasty issue with the {Bg,Fg}ColorButton when showing a
stack without calling createUI() since it tries very, very, very hard to
always update the button even if the main window was never shown. The
stack trace looks like this:

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: There is no button associated with the specified tool

I wonder whether it makes sense to instantiate the ToolsService at all if
the main window was not even shown?

Dear All-

Thanks for your support, enthusiasm, and your patience on the arrangements on this meeting.  There have been alot of people to track.  Finally, here are the details:


1.       First meeting will be Nov 12-14 in Dundee.  We'll start first thing in the morning on the 2th, so plan on arriving Nov 11, or Nov 10 if necessary.  As most, but not all people could attend then, we'll schedule a follow-on remote meeting (using VoIP, shared screens etc.) in December, to follow up on any issues.  We have access to Webex, Adobe Connect and Jabber, IRC and others.  We can decide how we want to run that later, based on what we need.

2.       Wilma Woudenberg will make all travel arrangements for the November meeting.  She'll be in touch soon with more info.  Please do respond to any queries from Wilma  for details as soon as you can.

3.       All funding will be from Euro-BioImaging WP11 meeting funds.

4.       Current proposal is to use the scijava resources for all pre-meeting discussion and code sharing.  See:

https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scijava

and

 https://github.com/scijava/roi-model

This is not proscriptive- we just want something that works and is open and available.  Scijava is there, in use, and until it breaks seems the right thing to use.

5.       Most important will be review and consideration of docs and other resources that appear on scijava BEFORE the meeting, so that everyone comes ready to work.

6.       We will write a report on the output of these efforts, and include that in various reports that are part of Euro-BioImaging.  This report will summarise the problem, the activity, and reference the outputs in docs and software.  All participants and PIs will be listed as authors.  We can decide whether that should also be published separately later.

Just so we are clear, this is NOT a PI meeting (with lots of high level talks, PPTs, and people doing their emails), but work focussed on the technical details and implementation of a common ROI specification for our domain of bioimaging.

>From here on out, all discussion and arrangements will appear on scijava.

Thanks again.  See you in a few weeks.

Cheers,

Jason

P.S. Am sending identical email to CellProfiler, KNIME and Icy teams.  They are separate because otherwise they get blocked as spam (too many addresses).

Dear All-

Thanks very much for the responses, and the interest and commitment to this effort.  Yes, it's boring infrastructure, but it's also important and will deliver value to our scientists users.

Let me do some schedule checking and then get back to you all on final dates.  Will be in touch soon.

Cheers,

Jason

Hi everybody,

I would really like to participate as well. But I could unfortunately only make it 10-12 December.

Thanks a lot for organizing this Hackathon Jason!

Hope to see you soon,
Stephan

Dear All-

I'm writing following various discussions  regarding the definition and use of a common specification for multi-dimensional regions for biological imaging, and in particular biological microscopy.  I am cc'ing Michael Unser, Wiro Niessen and Antje Keppler on this email for reasons that I will describe below.  I've also included representation from OME, ImageJDev, KNIME, Icy, and CellProfiler.

The first concrete discussion on a common ROI spec was held in April in Barcelona.  Josh Moore's notes were circulated earlier (also, see below).

We now have an opportunity to finish this specification.  This follows from meetings sponsored by Euro-BioImaging (http://eurobioimaging.eu), and in particular The Data Management Work Package (often referred to as "WP11"), led by Wiro and Michael, and which I, through our work on OME, contribute to.  Through WP11, we have funds to sponsor a meeting that moves a common ROI spec towards completion.  The idea is to have a common specification, and example "proof-of-concept" software implementation(s) in at least a few of our projects, so that a region defined in one image software package can be used by another.  The emphasis is on transport and interop, and not, for example, on a single library for defining, using ROIs that must be used by all.  We already know the kind and level of standardization that works, and that which does not.

Given the progress we made in Barcelona, it seems that this is not a fantasy, but an achievable goal.  We don't propose a standard meeting with presentations, etc., but more of a developer meeting or "hackathon", that has been so successfully used by the ImageJ/Fiji teams and others.  We need to work through the specification (ideally making some progress beforehand using the various electronic tools we all know and love), and then get at least rough implementations in place.

As a start, we've used the scijava.org<http://scijava.org> site that was defined at the Dresden ImageJ/Fiji hackathon in Dec 2011.  See:

http://www.scijava.org/

As this was where our projects agreed to work together at the Dresden hackathon, it seemed a place where we could do this work, but this is not at all mandatory- just a place to start.  Whatever we use, it has to be usable for modern code development (in my opinion, that means, it has to be github or better, but other opinions welcome).  Obviously other resources can link to this.

Below "Resources", there is now a link to:

http://www.scijava.org/roi-model/

On this page are Josh Moore's notes from the Barcelona mtg.  With Lee Kamentsky's permission we can add his SpaceROI.xsd (email from 30 April), or a more recent update to it.  Roger Leigh (OME) has added his work on a draft model spec.  He can explain what is going on there.

For the mtg itself, we propose two possible dates- Nov 12-14 or Dec 10-12.  There are obviously several looming conflicts- US Thanksgiving, ASCB in SF, and several others.  I believe there is also an ImageJ hackathon looming.  So far there is strong preference for the November date.  Obviously minimising trans-ocean flights helps productivity and keeps us all in good graces with our families.  Wilma Woudenberg will send out a poll and we can try to get this nailed down.  If those dates don't work, we can go sooner or later, so speak up, but would be great to get this done before end of 2012.

For location, we've discussed Dresden, Dundee, and there may be others.  Through Euro-BioImaging, Dundee has funds to sponsor the meeting, and to support travel for participants (economy only).  If possible, Dundee will do all travel arrangements, to save the fun of travel reimbursements from EU grants.

I wasn't exactly sure who was interested, and we don't yet have a single mailing list that covers all of us, although the SciJava google group (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scijava) has been used for some  discussions.    This problem will get worse when we need our various developers to talk to each other.  I know many of the OME devs read the ImageJdev list, but that is not universal.  Note that some of the email lists included require registration, so do we use scijava at googlegroups?

Ok, this a too long email.  Decisions needed:

-- do we agree to use scijava to start this discussion?
-- can we put materials, discussions we each have there?
-- date for meeting-is there another scheduled event we should piggyback on? (Note I think things like the ImageJ mtg are not a good idea; too many other things going on)
-- everyone OK with Dundee for mtg place??

Note: I'm partial to Dundee, since we have to pay for everything, so it saves admin hassle, but if this can be solved easily, then that's fine.  Wilma will take care of Doodle polls and very likely travel.

We've worked together well in the past, so hopefully we can get this done, and build something that will truly help our scientist users.

Cheers,

Jason

P.S. As Euro-BioImaging will sponsor meeting, the various leaders of WP11 and also Antje Keppler, Euro-BioImaging PM are cc'd.

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] ImageJ 2.0.0-beta5 released
Message-ID: <CADN69ym9U+ofaS8qZ0iHnGO23o788C-+y0=AuGi1-2xPQ0UksA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

The ImageJDev team has released the fifth beta of ImageJ2, version 2.0.0-
beta5.

ImageJ 2.0.0-beta5 is a "beta"-quality release, meaning the code is not
finished. The design is more stable than before but still subject to change
until the final 2.0.0 release. It is recommended that people continue to
use ImageJ v1.x for critical work.

The ImageJ2 user interface is modeled after ImageJ v1.x as much as
possible. However, under the hood, ImageJ2 is a complete redesign of
ImageJ. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ by
bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between "legacy" and "modern"
image structures.

Development of this release of ImageJ focused on the addition of scripting
support. The release was timed to coincide with the ImageJ conference in
Luxembourg, to ensure participants have access to a recent, stable
codebase. Since the development cycle for this beta was shorter than many
of our previous cycles, there are fewer new major features. But we have
made substantial progress on some big ticket items (such as multi-step undo
and redo) that will be part of the next beta release.

For further details on this release, including a discussion of new
features, please see our blog post:
  http://developer.imagej.net/2012/10/19/imagej-v200-beta5

You can download the release from:
  http://developer.imagej.net/downloads

To more accurately reflect what is left to do, we have recently reestimated
ImageJ2's release dates, and scheduled additional betas before the final
2.0.0 release. See the Downloads page for the updated table of planned
future releases and roadmap links for the project. The focus of the next
release (2.0.0-beta6) is on robust core support for N-dimensional data,
including very large image data, and data/display decoupling.

Nice work guys.

Small issues I run into:

'x' cuts for all rectangular ROIs, whereas 'f' fills in only the
selected rectangular ROIs. One would expect 'f' and 'x' and others to
consistently work either for all or for the selected ROIs, but not a
mixed bag.

This beanshell script:

import ij.IJ;
IJ.log("hello world");

... fails to execute with the error:

Caused by: Sourced file: null : Error in method invocation: Method
log( java.lang.String ) not found in class'imagej.ImageJ' : at Line: 2
: in file: <unknown file> : IJ .log ( "hi" )

... which seems to indicate that the "log" method is not found in the
class where it is invoked.

That would be so nice! I am at the ImageJ conference and have little to no
time right now.

By the way I wanted to comment on the issue about the beanshell
interpreter but the trac system is not sending me a password.

The comment is short: if in beanshell one writes "import ij.IJ;" one
expects that the IJ class of the ij.jar is imported. No magic should
happen. And then IJ.log will open the old log from IJ1. If one wants a
new log surely IJ2 has a new way of echoing to the screen.

Note that "IJ" in ImageJ2 scripting refers to the current ImageJ context,
i.e. an instance of imagej.ImageJ. It does *not* refer to the static class
ij.IJ -- which would not make too much sense anyway, because we are most
likely not able to support too many of that class' functions.

Ciao,

Johannes,

the ij.jar is a jar and is included in ImageJ2. I understand it may be
desirable to intercept some of its functionality such as IJ.log and
redirect it, but other than that, being a jar, one would except
beanshell and other scripting languages to load and use jars in the
classpath as usual.

As in plain Java, if you have a local variable of the same name as a class
you imported, the local variable takes precedence. You can always access
the class by the full class name: ij.IJ.log("Hello, Albert");

I am open to suggestions what might be a better name for the current
ImageJ context (I considered "context", "this", "ImageJ", which all clash
with existing entities even worse than "IJ"). It is still early enough to
change things without much of a hassle.

Ciao,
Johannes

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Build failure with NetBeans
Message-ID: <508907B4.9020402@inria.fr>

Hi everyone,

First of all, I'm new here. I've just been hired to work on an ImageJ 
plugin and I don't know much about imageJ yet.

As I wanted to use netbeans to develop my stuff, I followed the 
instructions provided here : http://developer.imagej.net/netbeans
Of course everything works fine until the Build step...

I basically get errors in tests which apparently makes the whole build 
fail (attached is the whole build output).

Trying to go further, I tried to build the ImageJ Application project 
and got the following error :
Failed to execute goal on project ij-app: Could not resolve dependencies 
for project net.imagej:ij-app:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT: The following 
artifacts could not be resolved: 
net.imagej:ij-script-java:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT, 
net.imagej:ij-ui-swing-script-editor:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT: Failure to find 
net.imagej:ij-script-java:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT in 
http://maven.imagej.net/content/repositories/releases was cached in the 
local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update 
interval of imagej.releases has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1]

If anyone could get me back into the right way, it would be much 
appreciated ;-)
David

Congratulations, and good luck!

Just out of curiosity, you are talking about ImageJ1 plugins, right?

That is a problem I introduced unfortunately. For technically interested:
the incremental deployment most likely broke due to newly-introduced
artifacts.

I will fix it and report back,
Johannes

It is fixed now. In case you are interested, I fixed the
'incremental-deploy.sh' script in fiji.git which is used to deploy both
Fiji and ImageJ incrementally (i.e. upload new versions to the Maven
repository where your Netbeans downloads them from).

Ciao,
Johannes

Thanks for your reactivity !

Regarding whether to write an ImageJ1 or ImageJ2 plugin, I must say I do 
not know.
What we do want is the plugin to be available to the majority of end users.
As I understood it, ImageJ1 plugins will get to work with ImageJ2 thanks 
to a compatibility layer. However I am not sure of ImageJ2 plugins to 
work with ImageJ1. I hence tend to go toward a ImageJ1 plugin.

As for the problem I mentioned earlier, I didn't get around it yet, I'm 
actually not sure whether I'm using the correct repository.
I first tried with the git://github.com/imagej/imagej.git repo which is 
mentioned on the http://developer.imagej.net/netbeans page. This is when 
I got the error I posted previously.

However, as you mentioned fiji.git I thought that might have been my 
mistake and got this one instead : fiji.sc:/srv/git/fiji.git Well, it 
doesn't work better and neither seems to have received a commit today...

I'm sorry to have to ask for such basic assistance but which repo and 
which branch should I be fetching?

Thanks again
David

IJ1 plugins have the advantage that it works with IJ1, true. But they are
limited to the data types of IJ1. Depending on your Java skills, you might
want to use ImgLib2. There will be good tutorials on our Wiki soon.

It really depends what you want to do. If all you want is to write a
simple ImageJ1 plugin, the best idea would be to clone and enhance

	https://github.com/imagej/minimal-ij1-plugin

As to the newest commit:

	https://github.com/fiji/fiji

has it. Depending on my mood, I push to GitHub or fiji.sc and ImageJ's
Jenkins synchronizes them. You might have had a look too quickly, before
Jenkins could push it.

In any case, the problem in your existing ImageJ2 clone (without
re-fetching!) should be gone because the Maven repository was updated. All
you need to do is ask Netbeans to update the Maven dependencies.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi David,

Let's start at the beginning. Were you hired to develop a plugin for
ImageJ2 (under development) or ImageJ (1.x - around for many years)?

That's great, thanks a lot !

I think we'll go for an IJ1 plugin for now and check on IJ2 later on.
I pulled https://github.com/imagej/minimal-ij1-plugin and had to amend 
it only lightly in order to make it build : I updated sci-java pom 
version and added the repositories for imagej :

   <repositories>
     <repository>
       <id>imagej.releases</id>
<url>http://maven.imagej.net/content/repositories/releases</url>
     </repository>
     <repository>
       <id>imagej.snapshots</id>
<url>http://maven.imagej.net/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
     </repository>
   </repositories>


Looks like it wants to work !

Thanks again
David

Hi,

Well, as my boss didn't know about IJ2 being developed, the question was 
asked only a few hours ago.
It looks like we'd better stick to IJ1 for now and check on IJ2 later on.

Thanks,
David

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] CheckSezpoz
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1210261558530.5980@bonsai2>

Hi KNIME people,

at the ImageJ conference, I saw that you had exactly the same problem as
ImageJ2 has: Eclipse does not run sezpoz after compiling as mandated by
the Java specification (in incremental mode, it will never run anyway, you
have to Project>Clean...).

Our solution was to provide a class that checks explicitly for the case
when sezpoz was not run.

Please find our class in

	https://github.com/imagej/imagej/blob/master/core/core/src/main/java/imagej/util/CheckSezpoz.java

It probably needs a little bit of adjustment;

1) it expects the directory structure

	target/
		classes/
			<class path element>
	src/
		main/
			java/
				<sources required for sezpoz>

2) it cannot cope with .jar files (one could fix that, by inferring
cleverly where the source files are [*1*], outputting the META-INF/ stuff
into a temporary directory, adding that temporary directory to the class
path via reflection)

Maybe it helps you, too?

Ciao,
Dscho

Footnote *1*: at the moment, we actually retain the ImageJ2 annotations beyond
compilation, but we might be forced to make it a compile-time thing to
avoid the sezpoz dependency should we decide to push the annotations down
into imglib2.

Most of the ImageJ2 developers use the same set of tools, so it is strange
that you are having this problem.

Are you using Eclipse 3.7 or later? Earlier versions of Eclipse and M2E had
many bugs.

I am sorry that you have had trouble getting set up. We have tested on a
variety of configurations (various OSes, and IDEs including Eclipse,
NetBeans and IDEA, as well as command line with vim + mvn) and all these
options are intended to be largely painless to configure.

Anyway, without more information, it is difficult to say why you are
getting that NPE. Have you tried building and running from the command line
[2]? Have you tried the same procedure from a second machine? Have you
tried cloning the source code from outside Eclipse (e.g. "git clone git://
github.com/imagej/imagej.git") and then using "File > Import > Existing
Maven Projects" on that folder?

Regards,
Curtis

I was able to duplicate the problem in my Windows VM. The problem is now
fixed with the latest code on the master branch. (If you are curious: the
bug resulted from Windows's convention of backslash rather than forward
slash for directory separator.)

Please let us know if you still have any trouble!

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Calem,

> Which IDE do you suggest?

We seriously want the project to work well in any Maven-enabled
environment. So actually, it would be helpful for you to stick to your most
preferred IDE, and report any issues you encounter.

That said, if you really want to know which tools the core developers use,
the breakdown is roughly:

5x: Windows + Eclipse
1x: Windows + NetBeans
2x: OS X + Eclipse
1x: OS X + Eclipse, vim, mvn
1x: OS X + NetBeans, Xcode
2x: Linux + Eclipse, vim, mvn

We have a dearth of IDEA users right now so you could use that just to
cover all our bases. ;-)

> My primary goal write now is to quickly convert a MatLab project into
> an ImageJ Plug-in.

Presumably, your goal is to break the dependency on MATLAB? If not, and you
just want to get the data into ImageJ by any means necessary, have you seen
this?
    http://fiji.sc/Miji

If you need to cut MATLAB out of the picture, you could try a drop-in
replacement such as JMathLib:
    http://www.jmathlib.de/

Either way, you will still need to write the ImageJ side of things, too.

> I believe I may move on to help develop the ImageJ core later on.

We would love for additional developers to get on board. With GitHub it is
very easy to start contributing code upstream right away using Pull
Requests.

> I imagine that you guys would prefer plug-ins were developed

Definitely; it will likely help you in the long term to develop for
ImageJ2. You will pay a price in the short term since ImageJ2 is still in
beta and you'll have to work harder to learn the system (less
documentation, etc.). But we are more than happy to help and answer
questions via the mailing list.

> Where would I find material on how to get started developing plugins
> for 2.0?

ImageJ2 supports several different kinds of plugins. You probably want a
"command" which is a runnable operation that takes certain parameters as
inputs, and produces others as outputs.

The web site has a brief discussion of commands here, with an example:
    http://developer.imagej.net/extensibility

And check out the ImageJ2 Tutorials:
    https://github.com/imagej/imagej-tutorials

We plan to add many more tutorials over the next months as we prepare for
the first 2.0.0 release.

You can also study the various commands present in the ij-commands-*
projects. For example, check out ParameterTester (press Ctrl+Shift+T in
Eclipse to quickly locate classes) for an illustration of the supported
input types.

Lastly, we did an "ImageJ2 Plugins" workshop at the 2012 ImageJ Conference
in Luxembourg last week. Those examples are currently posted at:
    http://fiji.sc/ijconf/

...and they will be committed to the Git repository soon.

Regards,
Curtis
