Hi,

by chance I ran a "git shortlog -n -s" today. It seems that I am precisely
at 1000 commits. Woot! Barry, do you feel my breath in your neck? ;-)

Ciao,

Our project management is very open (we follow an open process, that's why
I always Cc: the list back when I answer mails such as yours that are of
wider interest than to merit a private-only response), you can see
literally all of the things we planned and their progress:

Do you mean you try to update it? I ask because you would get permission
problems if you tried to upload it: we cannot just allow everybody to upload
new versions of core ImageJ files...

--- Comment #2 from Johannes Schindelin <johannes.schindelin at gmx.de> ---
>From a mail reply:

Yes, I was trying to update ImageJ.  I followed the directions to  some files
since the updater was not working,
" Unfortunately, there was a bug in the ImageJ updater that affected the update
of the updater itself. The easiest way to get back a functional updater is to
import this URL via File>Import>URL....
If that does not work, please delete the files
ij-ui-swing-updater-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar, ij-updater-core-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar and
ij-core-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar from the Fiji.app/jars/ directory (MacOSX users,
Ctrl-click on the Fiji icon and select Open Package Contents and open           
thejars/ directory you see there). After that, the Updater should magically
repair itself."
 and then tried updating.  Things still did not work, so I went to the site
that was indicated to get the newest version for updating, launched it and this
problem came up.
"If that still fails, please download a fresh copy from here:
Download
We have continuous releases thanks to ImageJ's Jenkins server:"
Please tell me if I am doing something incorrectly.  I was certainly not
interested in getting something that is not for general use.

Hi Carol,

it is good that you specified exactly the steps you performed because that was
not clear from the original bug report. Based on the original account, I had
chased around for 30 minutes before I gave up and admitted to myself that I
failed at reproducing your issue.

Unfortunately, even after the additional report, I am unable to reproduce. This
time, I just followed the following steps:

- downloaded a .zip from
http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/Stable-Fiji/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/fiji-win64.zip

- unpacked it onto the Desktop

- ran ImageJ-win64.exe from there

- it wanted to update ij-core, which I let it do.

- restarted as suggested

- called up the updater again

- it said "up-to-date!"

As I spent already some time on this issue today, I might have to shift
additional endeavors to fix your problem to another day, based on your
feedback.

For the record: it would be good if you sent your response by logging in to
http://fiji.sc/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=585. Our BugZilla is not set up to
understand response mails.

Hi everyone,

Looks like these bug reports from Michael Schmid (from the ImageJ
2.0.0-beta5 release) slipped through my fingers. Sorry, Michael!

I am forwarding to the list so we have a public record.

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Curtis,

finally I had time to look at it - not bad at all!  Especially cleaning up
some Roi/overlay and 'composite image/channels' issues of IJ1 is good
approach!

Here are a few points that I have encountered - I have not delved into how
to create tickets in a formally correct way. If appropriate, could you
enter them or forward to someone for entering?

Image>Adjust>Auto-Contrast for 32-bit float images always gave an
incredibly high number as minimum (it seems to be Double.MAX_VALUE):
179,769,313,486,231,570,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
Obviously, then it does not display the image with reasonable contrast.
Also, large numbers like this should be displayed in exponential format.

Image>Adjust/Brightness contrast does not accept exponential notation like
1e2 with lowercase 'e'.

Image>Adjust/Brightness overrides the input if one has a small range for a
32-bit image (e.g. if I want to see the range 0 to 0.0001 in an image with
range -10 to 10). Then, if I want to set the minimum, it also destroys my
previous maximum setting, and other way round.

Image>Adjust/Brightness Usability: A 'full range' or 'default' button
(brightness=50, contrast=50) would be welcome.

Analyze>Histogram plot does not work for 32-bit float image

Image>Duplicate should allow to enter the name of the copy and suggest a
NEW name as default, such as "blobs-1" for image "blobs"

Windows menu should list all open windows.

Currently, IJ2 keeps all selections; it's like IJ1 with the shift key
pressed when drawing further selections (at least under OS X 10.6.8, Java
1.6.0_35). I prefer the IJ1 behavior, that drawing a selection deletes the
old one(s) unless shift is pressed.
If you keep it like this, deleting an overlay/Roi must be easier: e.g.
right-click on it and have a context menu entry 'Delete overlay' or 'delete
selection'.

Selecting an image by clicking into it (while a selection tool is active in
the toolbar) should not create a new Roi (maybe unless the user drags to
extend the roi).  Even worse, clicking on the white space below an image
(if the window is larger than the image, such as for the 'Blobs' sample,
see also ticket #1060) currently also creates a new Roi.

On a German keyboard, the '+' key is currently mapped to 'Show all' instead
of 'Zoom in'. On this keyboard, it delivers the keyCode 93, which
corresponds to ']' on a US keyboard. Similarily, the '-' key does not work
for 'Zoom Out', because on a German keyboard it delivers keyCode 47, the
same as the slash on US keyboards. The Numpad + and - keys are ok.

Creating a selection on an image shown at a zoom level different from 100%
can cause the image to snap back to 100% zoom. (OS X 10.6.8, Java 1.6.0_35)

---

Sorry for the long list; but if I remember how many problems I have
reported on IJ1 it is still very short ;-)

Recently the Histogram Plot command was improved. Support of float images
is one of the enhancements in place.

IJ2 keeps all selections (and auto populates the Overlay Manager) by
design. The issue of context menus for overlays (including delete) is known
and will be addressed. See: http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1084

 Maybe as a compromise, we should encourage users to report problems on
 GitHub, but we still need to make it possible to respond to Trac tickets
 people are Cc:ed on.

Comment (by curtis):

 Indeed, we could use GitHub for "user-facing" tickets and the Trac for
 "developer-facing" work. I am ambivalent, because it better targets the
 scope of each system. But the dichotomy could lead to duplicate or
 confusingly similar tickets. Ultimately I am leaning against it but more
 discussion would be good.

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Questions about recent I/O and drag and drop work
Message-ID: <CADN69ymGxOfatYNFCiPnimGG22J6WkjDX75FxUk2YT_rmZW2yQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone (mostly core ImageJ2 and SCIFIO developers),

I recently completed some work to make drag-and-drop extensible:
    https://github.com/imagej/imagej/commit/9f20b3ec

It is now possible to define a new DragAndDropHandler plugin for dealing
with an arbitrary MIME type and/or Java class, which is pretty nice.

Further, since then I have done a little bit more work on supporting
various text formats:
    https://github.com/imagej/imagej/commit/a34d1b2e
    https://github.com/imagej/imagej/commit/cb6e8b76

There is now a TextFormat plugin type, for providing extensibility in
dealing with text documents in various markup languages such as Markdown.

Also, the IOService now has a generic "Object load(File)" method that is
intended for use by the ImageJ UI's File Open command (which now resides in
the OpenFile class).

However, doing all this has led me to the conclusion that the drag-and-drop
work is a little mis-structured. Dragging and dropping *any* files onto
ImageJ should, if there is no higher priority DnD handler available, just
call IOService#load(File) on them, since it is intended to be the
high-level entry point. Of course, we can also provide higher priority
handlers to do things like apply a LUT to the image onto which it was
dragged. But the fallback case should be "just open the file as though it
had been chosen via File Open." We want to avoid a scenario where
drag-and-drop of a file works, but File Open does not.

If so, this means getting rid of ImageFileDragAndDropHandler,
ScriptFileDragAndDropHandler and part of LUTFileDragAndDropHandler in favor
of a single DefaultFileDragAndDropHandler which calls IOService#load on the
files. (We would still need the LUTFileDragAndDropHandler, but only to
handle the case where a LUT was dragged onto an image display specifically.)

However, if we go that route, extensibility of IOService#load must then be
solved in a similar fashion. We should have a new IOHandler, which provides
handling of Files (and maybe other data sources such as URLs?) of various
types. At first glance, this may seem dangerously close to reinventing
SCIFIO again... but the difference is that SCIFIO only handles image data.
The IOHandler would be simpler than SCIFIO, but also more general, allowing
total extension of IOService#load (and hence the File Open command).

In the case of scripts, some reconciliation with the scripting framework
will be necessary, because right now, the Script Editor is not a Display.
That is, there is no type of Java object that IOService#load can return
when opening a script that results in a Script Editor window popping up to
display/edit it. But I believe this can be addressed.

Thoughts? Agree, disagree?

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Stephane & everyone,

> Bio-Formats library is able to do so it could be limited in some way.

Bio-Formats provides an API for opening very large image planes in tiles:

    byte[] openBytes(int no, int x, int y, int w, int h)
    byte[] openBytes(int no, byte[] buf, int x, int y, int w, int h)

Any valid tile width and height should behave correctly, but for optimal
performance you can ask for the data's ideal tile size using:

    int getOptimalTileWidth()
    int getOptimalTileHeight()

So hopefully it would not be too difficult for Icy to provide a "crop image
on import" sort of feature -- and maybe eventually a tile-based image
viewer. Please let us know if you have any trouble with it!

Regards,
Curtis

P.S. This week, the ImageJ2 team will be working on the underpinnings in
ImgLib2 for a SCIFIO-driven CellImg with intelligent disk caching. Once
this work is ready, and if Icy becomes capable of using ImgLib2 data
structures at the interface level, you could potentially harness this
feature for tile-based image support.

Hi Curtis,

Thanks for the information.
We are currently testing the following method to open image tile by tile:
   byte[] openBytes(int no, byte[] buf, int x, int y, int w, int h)

but it appears that all reader do not support it very well, we tested both 
on JPEG and NDPI reader and obtained errors in both case. Is there any way 
to know how much this method is supported ?

Glad to hear about the IJ2 work on smart image disk caching, i am impatient 
to see that in action :)

Cheers,

- Stephane

Message-ID: <18FB09F4-9E92-4B3B-8C10-4A403A806F53@janelia.hhmi.org>

Hi everyone,

as some of you may know, a precursor of our image processing library ImgLib2 (http://imglib2.net) exists, which is called ImgLib1. It still lives in Fiji and in the imglib repository. The plan is to get rid of it in both places within this week to finally migrate to ImgLib2 entirely.

The plan is to integrate it into the SPIM Registration plugin which still makes heavy use of it to gradually convert it to ImgLib2 as well. So for people who still want to use it can do so by importing the SPIM Registration plugin and the jars will also be available for download on a webpage.

If anybody has any objections to that please let us know.

Nice greetings,
Stephan

The 3d viewer (marching cubes) and TrakEM2 depend on ImgLib1. I will
have time to work on it this Summer, not earlier than August.

What needs to be done:
 (1) Convert the Marching Cubes code in the 3D Viewer to use ImgLib2.
Should be easy and straightforward.
 (2) Create a Shape (as in java.awt.Shape) planar Img, which TrakEM2
would then use to present collections of java.awt.geom.Area as an Img
to the Marching Cubes.

I have created twice the ShapeImg in ImgLib2 and both times it was
erased. I would appreciate if now you guys create it. It won't take
long. Put it in an ImgLib2 package that has java.awt dependencies.

Albert

Hi Albert,

that should be no problem. You have any time to update it. What we plan to do is just move ImgLib1 into the SPIM_Registration until the entire migration is finished. This will take time, but it discourages new users from still using ImgLib1. You just have to update the TrakEM2 pom.xml to import SPIM_Registration instead of ImgLib1 until you finished porting your stuff.

If you have specialized implementations like ShapeList that do not really migrate to ImgLib2 well, I would just put it into TrakEM directly or into imglib2-algorithms-legacy. There I have some of my implementations that are not "properly" ported to ImgLib2.

Does that sound ok?

Bye bye,
Stephan

So you'll make the 3D Viewer dependent on the SPIM package?

We just figured that this will not work due to circular dependencies. We will therefore make a new package legacy-imglib1.jar that will contain all imglib1 packages. So one just needs to add this as dependency. Should be ok too ...

Should work, thanks Stephan. But creating a ShapeImg for ImgLib2 will
likely take less time that doing all of this. It is a very straightforward
implementation, most of which can be copied over from ImgLib1.

Was the class called something other than "ShapeImg"? I can't find any
classes by that name in the git history ("git log --all -p | grep ShapeImg"
returns nothing). Or was it rebased away?

Thanks,
Curtis

Hi Curtis,

can't remember the name of the class, but a search for java.awt.Shape or
just Shape should bring it up.

Hi,

it's been ShapeList and ShapeListSeries, the former being 2D-RealRA and
the latter nD-RA as all >2 dimensions are discrete.

git log --all -p | grep imglib2.*ShapeList

brings them up.  I remember because we've ported that together in a rush
at Janelia.  No idea what happened further, I didn't need them myself.

Hope that helps a bit.

Best,
Stephan

Hi again,

Johannes did the merge, we have a new project called "legacy-imglib1", it lives in src-plugins. All plugins in the Fiji master are already updated, I will push it in the next 5 minutes. For any submodules that depend on imglib1 - like TrakEM2 - just remove all references to imglib in the pom.xml and instead add:

		<dependency>
			<groupId>sc.fiji</groupId>
			<artifactId>legacy-imglib1</artifactId>
			<version>${imagej.version}</version>
		</dependency>

This is all. It is basically not more than a incentive to start migrating to imglib2.

The next step is to remove imglib1 entirely from the imglib repository. We will do that now. We will remove one directory layer as there is no differentiation between imglib1 and imglib2 any more.

Bye bye,
Steffi

That's a great solution, thanks Johannes and Stephan. In this way, ImgLib1
is still distributed in Fiji, and the 3D Viewer and TrakEM2 can continue
working as they are. Additionally, the ImgLib1 scripting can also continue
as it is, which guarantees that the example scripts in the Nature Methods
paper continue to run, as well as the examples in the Fiji tutorial in
Jython that I wrote. (It is surprising how many labs are using ImgLib1
indirectly via the scripting classes from jython, some of them here at
Janelia.)
