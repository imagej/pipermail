Subject: [ImageJ-devel] ImageJ2 beta delayed
Message-ID: <BANLkTik2f033d2qjUh9CNBscFTpuKBwUVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

According to the ImageJ2 roadmap, the first beta version 2.0.0 is due for
release today. However, for a variety of reasons, we must postpone the
release. For details, see our blog post:

  http://imagejdev.org/2011/07/01/first-imagej2-beta-delayed

We apologize to everyone for the delay, but hope that taking the needed time
now will ultimately result in better software for many years to come.

Regards,
Curtis Rueden
ImageJ2 project lead

Hi Curtis, et al.

I've started going through the IJ-Commands-All google doc to testing each
command by hand. The plan was/is:

for each command:

   - Manually test in IJ1 & IJ2 simultaneously making sure to try it in
   different contexts
   - Record actions as a macro.
   - Update IJ-Commands-All doc (did anything break in IJ2?)
   - Add macro text to test script

However, I'm already running into several bugs that aren't necessarily the
fault of the command itself, and some that simply can't be demonstrated via
a macro. In these cases, I've been writing down a description of the bug and
how to reproduce it, but a text document on my local machine is hardly the
place for this list to reside. Still, I'm hesitant to just start filing lots
of bugs in the imagejdev trac. Does anyone have suggestions for how to
approach this methodically so the issues get seen by someone who can
determine their severity and fix/ignore/dismiss them as they see fit?

-Adam

My initial thought is that the ImageJDev bug tracker is exactly the sort of
tool that will facilitate such things. Each area of the code is by default
"owned" by a particular person. If you provide an initial assessment of
severity and categorize the bug, it will go to that person, who can review
the situation further. If you like, we can discuss further over text or
voice.

How about using some GUI test framework such as Abbot:

	http://abbot.sourceforge.net/doc/overview.shtml

I haven't had much experience with it, but the feature list and the 
activity look promising. I will try to have a closer look this afternoon, 
but the two features which appeal to me the most are the recordability and 
the integration into JUnit testing (one should be able to turn them off 
for headless Jenkins jobs, of course).

Will keep you posted,
Dscho

Hrm, I'm not convinced that this isn't just going to make things more
complicated than they need to be.

I could see it being valuable however if it helps us generate unit tests as
we go along fixing these issues.

Whatever the case, we need to decide on a workflow as soon as possible.
