<PRE>Hi all,

I would like to add something to Mark's request.  In general it is not trivial to see how one would create a new data type structure and create a display for it.  For example, in ImageJ1, a PlotWindow simply extends an ImageWindow and overrides its draw method to add buttons to the window.  That allows for duplication of functions like copy, zoom, rois, etc.  This is the kind of thing that ImageJ2 in principle makes much easier with the abstract character of the display and dataset classes.  Nevertheless, without an example to guide me I am having a bit of trouble assessing which methods I need to override and which ones I don't.  In addition, it isn't clear how to gain access to the image frame to create the buttons themselves.  Of course, it may be that putting buttons into a window isn't appropriate, since the underlying data model may provide access to copy and edit functions within the existing image display model.  I looked into the Histogram Plot plugin for guidance, but it simply creates a stand alone frame that doesn't extend any of the internal abstract classes or provide data access.

Thanks,
Jay

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Basic usage of ImageJ2 libraries in seperate application (Simple display image in JFrame)

Dear All,

I have a (hopefully) simple question. I have a separate application which launches a JFrame which displays a DICOM image and provides basic functionality like zooming and ROI. I have this working with ImageJ libraries no problem (ImagePlus etc).

I would like to replicate this using the new ImageJ2 libraries.
However, when looking through the likely classes to guide me, I find myself getting lost!.
I simply wish to display an image in a JFrame and provide the basis functionality that a standard ImageJ2 window does (zooming, scrolling through slices etc).

Is there any help or advice you can give.

Cheers,
Mark
