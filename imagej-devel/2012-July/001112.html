<PRE>Hi all

&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I cc'ed the imagej-devel list, because this should be of wider interest.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The gist of the mails quoted below is that we (Christian Dietz,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jean-Yves Tinevez) are trying to unify the LocalNeighborhood (-Cursors)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that have been popping up in different places in ImgLib2.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Currently, most of the relevant source can be found in package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> net.imglib2.algorithm.region.localneighborhood in algorithms-gpl.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe Jean-Yves and Christian could provide some more information on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual neighborhoods that are implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BufferedRectangularNeighborhood is a very simple ring-buffer implementation, to reduce the number of pixel-accesses (yes there is a speed-up).
</I>&gt;<i> Additionaly I wrapped the HyperSphere stuff of Stephan Preibisch (HyperSphereNeighborhood).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I think there is no need for that: there is already a HyperSphere class which has the role of the neighborhood. We need to convince Stephan to tweak it to fit into the hierarchy. 
&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.) Factory vs. CopyOn()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A factory could be constructed with parameters, for instance the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CellContainerFactory is constructed with cell dimensions. So a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HypersphereNeighborhood could be constructed with the radius for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example. However, I don't see much harm in adding the copyOn() method.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Having only updateSource() would be too little, as we might want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change the type T of the Neighborhood in copyOn() and only keep the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structure.In general, I don't like the updateSource() very much. For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instance,what happens if the new source has a different number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dimensions?
</I>&gt;<i> I agree. As long as one can simulate the updateSource() behaviour (maybe with copyOn) everything is fine.
</I>&gt;<i> But as you mentoined, how would we handle sources with more dimensions in copyOn? For instance copyOn on a RectangularNeighborhood (with 3,5,7 spans) is called with a
</I>&gt;<i> 4-d source. What would be the span in this dimension?
</I>
I suggest by contract: 0. We would copy the span array to the new copy, and take the smallest array size as a limit. So that has soon as the numDimensions() are not equal, 0s are fed to the span. It is the role of the concrete implementation to ensure it makes sense. E.g.: copying a sphere to a 2D image should make it a disc. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.) Neighborhood interface
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In addition to Positionable and IterableInterval, it could extend Localizable to get the position of the center.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yap. Perfect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>setSpan(long[] span);
span(long[] span);
copyOn(RandomAccessible&lt;T&gt; target)

I would like also to have a mother interface for the cursor, that would allow methods like

relativeDistance(int dim); // from the neighborhood center
relativeSquareDistance();
etc...


&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3.) IN extends RandomAccessibleInterval&lt;T&gt; parameter in AbstractNeighborhood, etc
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think all the Neighborhoods should be constructed on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RandomAccessible&lt;T&gt; instead of RandomAccessibleInterval&lt;T&gt;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If interval extension is required then this should be done outside of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Neighborhood. If we do this, then the IN parameter is no longer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> required, right? The Neighborhood is just constructed with any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RandomAccessible&lt;T&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Tobias also suggest to make a double type to be more generic than just ExtendedRI etc&#8230; Could you do it? I am not strong enough with the generics to make it right.


&gt;&gt;<i> 4.) move to imglib2 core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Eventually, the neighborhood should be moved to the core, maybe with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exception of rather special-case stuff like DiscNeighborhood.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or is ops a better place? What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From my point of view it should be in the core, as these are basic data-structures.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>When the first 3 concrete implementations are done ok? 

Also i plan on removing DiscNeighborhood and SphereNeighborhood from imglib2: they are too specific and clumsy and do not fit what we are designing here. They are related to the ability to position a neighborhood using calibrated, real coordinates, as is x = 6.5 &#181;m, etc.. taking advantage of the calibration in IngPlus&lt;T&gt; 

The neighborhood hierarchy we are designing deal with pixel coordinates only and this is right. 

Cheers
