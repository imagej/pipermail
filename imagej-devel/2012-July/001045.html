<PRE>Hi Stephan,

Basically, the problem with snapshot versions is that they are moving
targets. So imglib2-2.0.0-beta3 cannot depend on mpicbg-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.
That was my thinko and Curtis corrected that.

&gt;<i> To explain the mpicbg situation: I consider the version of the git
</I>&gt;<i> repository that is committed as submodule to the fiji repository the
</I>&gt;<i> stable release because I tested it in the full Fiji context (at least
</I>&gt;<i> for compiling issues) which includes TrakEM2 and ImgLib1/2.  That
</I>&gt;<i> version corresponds to what is uploaded to the Fiji updater.
</I>
Okay, that would be version 20120621, then, as that is the date of the
commit in fiji.git, referring to the mpicbg commit 4200032831.

I verified that the Updater considers my compiled version of that revision
and what you uploaded as identical, so I &quot;deployed&quot; (== &quot;uploaded to the
Maven repository&quot; in Maven speak) the latter[*1*].

&gt;<i> The dependencies in imglib2 are wrong transformed comments.  imglib2-ij,
</I>&gt;<i> imglib2-algorithms-gpl, imglib-scripting and imglib2-tests use utility
</I>&gt;<i> classes that I will transfer to imglib2 in August now that I've seen it.
</I>&gt;<i> imglib2-algorithms-gpl and imglib-scripting use it for transformation
</I>&gt;<i> which can now be replaced by imglib2-realtransform (actually the
</I>&gt;<i> transform as implemented there is obsolete now that RealViews exist).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My plan is to free imglib2 from mpicbg dependencies because it will
</I>&gt;<i> incorporate all its functions wrapped in improved interfaces.  This,
</I>&gt;<i> however, is a longer term project which means that mpicbg will remain
</I>&gt;<i> for quite some time, mainly in the Fiji context for TrakEM2 and other
</I>&gt;<i> plugins.  Synchronizing version numbers between imglib2 and mpicbg would
</I>&gt;<i> thus be misleading in my understanding.
</I>
Okay, great, thanks for the clarification! Much appreciated.

&gt;<i> Be patient with me---I have to finish my thesis by July 31---no further
</I>&gt;<i> mercy.  Back in hacking mood after that...
</I>
Yep, the thesis is more important right now. Good luck with that!

Ciao,
Dscho

[Footnote *1*] I did not upload my compiled version, since -- as you know
-- .jar files are really .zip files, storing timestamps with the files, so
by necessity the .jar files are different when they are recompiled. The
Updater is a bit clever about that situation and inspects the .zip
contents (in newer incarnations, it ignores even more things that depend
on the build environment/date).
