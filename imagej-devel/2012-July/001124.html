That's correct, unless you build Fiji in your Eclipse workspace as well.
Then you can add the dependencies to the pom.xml file.

For the moment, I have not deployed *any* Fiji artifacts, mainly because I
have to sort out a couple of issues first: since I want to deploy them
from Jenkins, I have to make sure that it does not try to re-deploy
non-snapshot versions (there are a couple ones in src-plugins/, most
notably imagescience and friends, which are stable releases and as such
really do not want the -SNAPSHOT suffix in their version).

It will take well into next week to sort out these issues, sorry!

Ciao,
Johannes
