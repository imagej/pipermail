<PRE>Hi Simon,

On Wed, 25 Jul 2012, <A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-devel">simon.ochsenreither at googlemail.com</A> wrote:

It means exactly that. The short-term impact is that there might be the
occasional hiccups, unfortunately.

&gt;<i> I have seen that a lot of changes and improvements have gone into

</I>
In general, yes, a lot of the stuff in Fiji will need to be ported to the
ImageJ2 architecture.

&gt;<i> ImageJ2 also uses Swing instead of AWT, so do plugins with a GUI need to
</I>&gt;<i> update or is the move handled transparently (and people can just keep
</I>&gt;<i> using e. g. GenericDialogPlus, etc.?)
</I>
ImageJ2 tries to be as GUI-agnostic as possible, wrapping the GUI-specific
parts in individual components. This allows other software to write
adapters to run ImageJ2 plugins within their framework. For example,
CellProfiler runs ImageJ2 plugins and it is not even a Java program but a
Python one.

The way plugins try to get their input is no longer by creating a dialog
explicitly. This is a nightmare if you want to run the same plugin
unchanged on a cluster. The way to interact with the user in ImageJ2 is by
annotating the fields you require as parameters. Example:

	@Plugin
	public class MyPlugin implements ImageJPlugin {
		@Parameter
		double value;

		public void run() {
			System.err.println(&quot;The value is &quot; + value);
		}
	}

ImageJ will figure out how to construct a dialog from the annotated
fields. Parameters do not need to be information to be gathered via a
dialog, though. For example, if you want to interact with a service (such
as the log service to report exceptions) you also add them as fields
annotated as a parameter.

&gt;<i> I searched for information on the website, but maybe you have a hint
</I>&gt;<i> where I can find more information about it?
</I>
Well, a couple of things might still be moving around, that's why we have
not yet written extensive documentation. But I will, promise.

Ciao,
Johannes
