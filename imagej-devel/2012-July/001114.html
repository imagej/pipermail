<PRE>Hi,

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 2.) Neighborhood interface
 &gt; setSpan(long[] span);
 &gt; span(long[] span);
 &gt; copyOn(RandomAccessible&lt;T&gt; target)

I think, the &quot;span&quot; concept is too specialised for the interface.
The assumption is that the bounding box of the neighborhood structuring 
element is 2*span[d]+1 in every dimension. The anchor point is assumed 
to be the center of this neighborhood.

We should think of non-symmetric neighborhoods as well.
I suggest that instead of a long[] span, we use an Interval to specify 
the bounding box. The anchor point is always the (0,0,...,0) of the 
interval. The above span would translate to interval.min[d] = -span[d], 
interval.max[] = span[d].

What would setSpan() do? Does this change the size and shape of the 
structuring element?

 &gt;
 &gt; I would like also to have a mother interface for the cursor, that would
 &gt; allow methods like
 &gt;
 &gt; relativeDistance(int dim); // from the neighborhood center
 &gt; relativeSquareDistance();
 &gt; etc...

Ok. I wonder whether all Neighborhoods should be required to implement 
this. Maybe we could have a hierarchy of interfaces. Neighborhood just
supplies a Cursor. NeighborhoodExt extends Neighborhood supplies a 
Cursor that also implements interface for relativeDistance() etc.

Note, that it is easy to write a generic wrapper that takes a 
Neighborhood and turns it into NeighborhoodExt by wrapping the Cursors.
So if you just want to hack up a Neighborhood quickly you wouldn't need 
to bother with implementing relativeDistance() etc.

Of course, I do not suggest to name the thing &quot;NeighborhoodExt&quot;...
:<i>-)
</I>
 &gt;&gt; From my point of view it should be in the core, as these are basic
 &gt;&gt; data-structures.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt; When the first 3 concrete implementations are done ok?

Sounds good!

best regards,
Tobias

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BufferedRectangularNeighborhood is a very simple ring-buffer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation, to reduce the number of pixel-accesses (yes there is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> speed-up).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Additionaly I wrapped the HyperSphere stuff of Stephan Preibisch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (HyperSphereNeighborhood).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there is no need for that: there is already a HyperSphere class
</I>&gt;<i> which has the role of the neighborhood. We need to convince Stephan to
</I>&gt;<i> tweak it to fit into the hierarchy.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1.) Factory vs. CopyOn()
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A factory could be constructed with parameters, for instance the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> CellContainerFactory is constructed with cell dimensions. So a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> HypersphereNeighborhood could be constructed with the radius for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> example. However, I don't see much harm in adding the copyOn() method.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Having only updateSource() would be too little, as we might want to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> change the type T of the Neighborhood in copyOn() and only keep the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> structure.In general, I don't like the updateSource() very much. For
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> instance,what happens if the new source has a different number of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dimensions?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree. As long as one can simulate the updateSource() behaviour
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (maybe with copyOn) everything is fine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But as you mentoined, how would we handle sources with more dimensions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in copyOn? For instance copyOn on a RectangularNeighborhood (with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3,5,7 spans) is called with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4-d source. What would be the span in this dimension?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest by contract: 0. We would copy the span array to the new copy,
</I>&gt;<i> and take the smallest array size as a limit. So that has soon as the
</I>&gt;<i> numDimensions() are not equal, 0s are fed to the span. It is the role of
</I>&gt;<i> the concrete implementation to ensure it makes sense. /E.g.: /copying a
</I>&gt;<i> sphere to a 2D image should make it a disc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2.) Neighborhood interface
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In addition to Positionable and IterableInterval, it could extend
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Localizable to get the position of the center.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yap. Perfect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> setSpan(long[] span);
</I>&gt;<i> span(long[] span);
</I>&gt;<i> copyOn(RandomAccessible&lt;T&gt; target)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like also to have a mother interface for the cursor, that would
</I>&gt;<i> allow methods like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> relativeDistance(int dim); // from the neighborhood center
</I>&gt;<i> relativeSquareDistance();
</I>&gt;<i> etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3.) IN extends RandomAccessibleInterval&lt;T&gt; parameter in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> AbstractNeighborhood, etc
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think all the Neighborhoods should be constructed on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> RandomAccessible&lt;T&gt; instead of RandomAccessibleInterval&lt;T&gt;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If interval extension is required then this should be done outside of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the Neighborhood. If we do this, then the IN parameter is no longer
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> required, right? The Neighborhood is just constructed with any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> RandomAccessible&lt;T&gt;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Agree.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tobias also suggest to make a double type to be more generic than just
</I>&gt;<i> ExtendedRI etc&#8230; Could you do it? I am not strong enough with the
</I>&gt;<i> generics to make it right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4.) move to imglib2 core
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Eventually, the neighborhood should be moved to the core, maybe with the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> exception of rather special-case stuff like DiscNeighborhood.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Or is ops a better place? What do you think?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From my point of view it should be in the core, as these are basic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data-structures.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the first 3 concrete implementations are done ok?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also i plan on removing DiscNeighborhood and SphereNeighborhood from
</I>&gt;<i> imglib2: they are too specific and clumsy and do not fit what we are
</I>&gt;<i> designing here. They are related to the ability to position a
</I>&gt;<i> neighborhood using calibrated, real coordinates, as is x = 6.5 &#181;m, etc..
</I>&gt;<i> taking advantage of the calibration in IngPlus&lt;T&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The neighborhood hierarchy we are designing deal with pixel coordinates
</I>&gt;<i> only and this is right.
