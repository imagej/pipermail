<PRE>Hi Curtis, Johannes,

&gt;<i>     But, then there are versions 2.0-SNAPSHOT and 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is my fault; I decided to change to a major.minor.micro versioning
</I>&gt;<i> scheme so we could use semantic versioning (<A HREF="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</A>). The
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;2.0-SNAPSHOT&quot; builds are obsolete, so I deleted them all. Hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> that clears up any confusion there. :-)
</I>
Yep, thanks. All set to 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT now.

&gt;<i> in Package Explorer, find any JAR under your
</I>&gt;<i> project's &quot;Maven Dependencies&quot; list, right-click it and choose &quot;Maven &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Download Sources&quot;. After that, you'll have them in your local cache (in
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.m2) and you can browse the sources in Eclipse, debug into them, etc.
</I>
That is cool. Thanks.

&gt;<i> So everything listed under the &quot;imagej&quot; groupId is old/deprecated, and
</I>&gt;<i> should not be used.
</I>
Got it. Everything is net.imagej now.

&gt;<i> I checked that page, but could not find the block you cited.
</I>
Looks like half of it was my own creation, sorry for the mis-citation.


&gt;<i> If you see
</I>&gt;<i> the old &quot;imagej&quot; groupId anywhere, please fix it, or let us know and I
</I>&gt;<i> will do so.
</I>
Only in relation to SNAPSHOTs and future releases right?

In the end I have made two new projects in Eclipse, both tracking
bonej.git. One is using my old Ant-based build system and is for BoneJ1,
and there is a mavenized new project BoneJ2 using the Maven build
system, pom.xml etc. They work on different branches of the git repo.

What I would like to do in the end is have ImageJ handle runtime
dependencies. Is there a way to tell Maven to make sure these things are
present at compile-time? In particular, I'd like to build against a
couple of plugins which are listed as modules in Fiji's
src-plugins/pom.xml AnalyzeSkeleton_ and LocalThickness. At the moment I
have to put their jars in the build path.

Michael
