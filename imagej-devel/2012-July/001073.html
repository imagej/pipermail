<PRE>Hi everyone,

Today the ImageJDev team is releasing the third beta of ImageJ2, version
2.0.0-beta3.

ImageJ 2.0.0-beta3 is a &quot;beta&quot;-quality release, meaning the code is not
finished. The design is more stable than before but still subject to change
until the final 2.0.0 release. It is recommended that people continue to
use ImageJ v1.x for critical work.

The ImageJ2 user interface is modeled after ImageJ v1.x as much as
possible. However, under the hood, ImageJ2 is a complete redesign of
ImageJ. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ by
bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between &quot;legacy&quot; and &quot;modern&quot;
image structures.

Development of this release of ImageJ2 focused heavily on making the
architecture and infrastructure more flexible and more capable of running
headlessly (without a GUI). To accommodate this, changes were made to
displays, menus, events, the updater and in many other areas. However,
there were also some improvements at the application level&#8212;all in all, over
100 bugfixes and improvements.

For further details on this release, including a discussion of new
features, please see our blog post:

You can download the release from:

the project.
