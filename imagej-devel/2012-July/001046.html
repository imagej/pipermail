It turns out that I was able to fix the bug in MiniMaven which wanted to
use the old mpicbg version to compile blockmatching even when the
corresponding pom.xml clearly asked for the newer version.

This was possible due to the Mavenization of Fiji which allowed me to
import the Fiji Build project into Eclipse (after identifying a rather
serious problem together with Tobias Pietzsch on Friday, I was able to fix
the problem today, see the Git log for Fiji's src-plugins/pom.xml). Well,
part of it was helped by Eclipse, since I could not attach Eclipse to
Jenkins' Fiji Builds.

Anyway, the problem is a non-issue now, please disregard my original
request to bump scijava to a new version.

Ciao,
Dscho
