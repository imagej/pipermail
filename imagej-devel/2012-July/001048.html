<PRE>Hi all,


&gt;<i> Basically, the problem with snapshot versions is that they are moving
</I>&gt;<i> targets. So imglib2-2.0.0-beta3 cannot depend on mpicbg-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.
</I>&gt;<i> That was my thinko and Curtis corrected that.
</I>

Yes, the good thing about release versions (i.e., any version without
&quot;-SNAPSHOT&quot; as the suffix) is that they never change after deployment
(i.e., once they are available to anyone external). The idea is that adding
a release version dependency creates a looser-and-more-stable linkage
between projects, whereas a snapshot dependency creates a
tighter-but-less-stable one.

The way we are doing it with ImageJ2 and ImgLib2 is that the development
version of ImageJ2 depends on an ImgLib2 snapshot. When we do a release, we
do a release for the entire stack, with both ImageJ2 and ImgLib2 versioned
the same (but if you want to change this in the future, we can discuss).

It is forbidden for a release version of a project to have any snapshot
dependencies (because then depending on that release would not be
transitively stable). Therefore, when we do a release of the ImgLib2
projects, we need a new-enough release version of mpicbg as well&#8212;at least
until the transition away from mpicbg is complete someday.


&gt;<i> Okay, that would be version 20120621, then, as that is the date of the
</I>&gt;<i> commit in fiji.git, referring to the mpicbg commit 4200032831.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I verified that the Updater considers my compiled version of that revision
&gt;<i> and what you uploaded as identical, so I &quot;deployed&quot; (== &quot;uploaded to the
</I>&gt;<i> Maven repository&quot; in Maven speak) the latter[*1*].
</I>

Sounds perfect!

Regards,
Curtis

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for compiling issues) which includes TrakEM2 and ImgLib1/2.  That

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The dependencies in imglib2 are wrong transformed comments.  imglib2-ij,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; imglib2-algorithms-gpl, imglib-scripting and imglib2-tests use utility
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; classes that I will transfer to imglib2 in August now that I've seen it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; imglib2-algorithms-gpl and imglib-scripting use it for transformation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which can now be replaced by imglib2-realtransform (actually the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transform as implemented there is obsolete now that RealViews exist).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My plan is to free imglib2 from mpicbg dependencies because it will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incorporate all its functions wrapped in improved interfaces.  This,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; however, is a longer term project which means that mpicbg will remain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for quite some time, mainly in the Fiji context for TrakEM2 and other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plugins.  Synchronizing version numbers between imglib2 and mpicbg would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thus be misleading in my understanding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, great, thanks for the clarification! Much appreciated.
