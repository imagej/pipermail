Heh... Good luck with all that!

No worries. It actually takes a little pressure from me, for which I am
thankful.

&gt;<i> What about the possibility that third party plugins, not-necessarily

</I>
To that end, I would seriously suggest to go a slightly different route:
if you are already on GitHub, there is this fantastic offer called
BuildHive (offered by CloudBees to Open Source projects for free):

	<A HREF="https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/">https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/</A>

It is basically that service you ask for: once you opted in, it will run
tests whenever you push new commits to your 'master' branch. All you need
to do is make a set of JUnit tests, which is really easy.

Ciao,
Dscho
