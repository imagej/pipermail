Hi, 
Just imagine you are working with an 8 bit image, then you want to see some 
contrast enhanced and apply a false colour LUT and then go back to the 
greyscale LUT.
If I saved this image which is now greyscale with the grey.lut, would this be 
re-opened as RGB? Maybe this is not such a good idea.

I do not know how IJ tests the LUT, but I guess it would be trivial: loop 
through the 256 entries and see if they are r=g=b in the expected sequential 
order. If so, then treat as 8bit greyscale image. Checking the table would 
tell you if there are any hidden colours.

Cheers

Gabriel
