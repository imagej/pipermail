</I>CellProfiler uses greedy coloring: 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_coloring">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_coloring</A> . I construct a graph of 
adjacent objects (and you can do things like distance transforms to 
create an array where all objects are expanded to fill the background to 
make them all adjacent so that nearby objects are colored differently). 
I order objects from most connected to least and make sure the color I 
assign is different from any of their connections - you're guaranteed to 
use as few colors as the most connected object + 1. Perhaps this is a 
way of recoloring any arbitrary image to make it colorblind-accessible 
(and possibly very ugly ;-)   ).
