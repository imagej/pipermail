<PRE>Hi all,
It would be nice, I suppose, to save the LUT in the spirit of not 
destroying information, but I agree that the primary objects of interest 
are the color indices. I have a feeling that people will save 
segmentation results this way, designating one color as background 
(typically zero = black) and then assigning colors from a color map to 
each value in the indexing range. One interesting possibility is to pick 
a handful of colors that are distant from each other and assign each to 
several possible index values (imagine 4 color theorem, but there are 
easy algorithms if you're allowed to use a few more - don't assign 
nearby or touching objects to the same color). The significant 
information in that case is the index, not the color.

Obviously, this scheme would fall apart if you had 256 or more objects 
in a 256-color indexed image; perhaps it's up to &quot;segmentation&quot; to 
interpret an image a segmentation result and reconstruct a labeling by 
identifying the unique colors in an image and assigning all pixels with 
the same color to the same object. This highlights one of the problems - 
the image opener doesn't have information on the use of the image, so it 
can't make the proper interpretation for the derived format and, in my 
opinion, it should not make any interpretation and instead try to 
preserve the information in the image file with as much fidelity as is 
possible and leave the interpretation to code downstream.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the table would tell you if there are any hidden colours.

</I>&gt;<i> that still uses bytes or shorts, but that cannot add/multiply/whatever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH if the LUT is just a view mode (as it should always be seen in
</I>&gt;<i> scientific imaging), then the LUT is not part of the image and should not
</I>&gt;<i> be saved in the first place. I often catch users insisting on the DAPI
</I>&gt;<i> channel being colored blue, when they should know fully well (because I
</I>&gt;<i> told them) that the DAPI channel is the result of a range of frequencies,
</I>&gt;<i> not blue.

</I>&gt;<i> In short: in most cases I hear people want index-color images, it turns

</I>&gt;<i> really, really important to keep the distinction in mind.
