Hi Tiago,

Thanks very much for pushing the documentation issue, and sorry for the long
delay in my reply.

I agree with Gabriel that perhaps many parts of the guide will be directly
applicable to IJ2, at least temporarily, but it will definitely need major
updates.

I think this is an important observation. What I would like to see is the
best of both worlds: exposing the online wiki documentation from within the
software itself, as built-in help. I also agree with your goal of creating a
system that can generate a self-contained document such as a PDF. We will be
in touch with you more later about deploying that system for IJ2. And we
will certainly be able to help you with the actual documentation effort,
when the time comes.

Right. Except that we will need to be more diligent about documenting every
command.

Another possibility is for the plugins themselves to allow for
self-documentation. We have this a bit already with a "description" field
for every input parameter, as well as for the plugin itself, but it could
perhaps be fleshed out more. Also might be good to add a URL link field.

Well, we will do what we can, but people tend to disagree on what is
"friendly." In the case of the black background option, we plan to eliminate
that option. If you want things to look inverted, you can just invert the
LUT. But maybe there will be some complaints about it?we'll see. Another
example is RGB color vs. 3-channel 8-bit unsigned integer composite images:
they display the same and are fairly redundant, so we are eliminating the
RGB color mode, except for legacy purposes.

CellProfiler modules have a nice way of documenting themselves to the point
where they can document each parameter that the user can fiddle with.
Formatting is done in via HTML, which I think is pretty common. This
documentation can be accessed from within the program itself and it can be
used to generate a doc.

Built-in help would be fantastic.

In terms of a tools outputting multiple formats, I just wanted to mention Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>.
It is the tool used for the Python documentation, using reStructuredText as markup language.
I always wanted to give it a try but never really had the chance.

Hi Curtis, all,
I'm looking at ModuleService.run and thinking of how to use it in 
CellProfiler. There's a comment:
// TODO - Implement a better threading mechanism for launching modules.
// Perhaps a ThreadService so that the UI can query currently
// running modules and so forth?

which is pretty relevant. I think that the natural thing to do would be 
to return java.util.concurrent.Future<Map<String, Object>> which would 
be a future promising the map of outputs for the module. You'd wrap the 
ModuleRunner in a java.util.concurrent.Callable<Map<String, Object>> 
instead of in a Runnable and use java.util.concurrent.FutureTask to 
return the future.

I like a programmatic style myself where you do things step-by-step 
instead of an event-driven style like a ThreadService. This would be 
great for scripting - you can imagine a script that executes a module, 
then, further down, gets the results from the execution. The script 
would proceed in parallel with the module execution and the additional 
boilerplate for threading would be minimal - just an additional call to 
Future.get() at the point where the result was needed.

Hi everyone,

Lee & I discussed a bit in the ImageJDev chat room, but for the benefit of
the list archives: this was done in several of today's commits:
