Hi John,

Very sorry for the delay in my reply; I have been struggling to catch up on
email since the ImageJDev announcement. I have CCed the ImageJDev list,
since other developers may have interest.

My question is this:  Would the scope of the long term interest include a

An infrastructure for RFP submission and tracking is a good idea. It is not
something we proposed in the initial two-year application, but would
definitely be of interest in the long term, and we would be glad to host
such a system on the imagejdev.org web site. Do you have any idea what would
be entailed, technically, in setting up and maintaining such a centralized
technical advisory resource?

For example, in our particular need, ORI is curious whether ImageJ could be

Our funding as of now is largely focused on software engineering, for the
development of a modular image processing core and next-generation ImageJ
interface. As such, there will not be a lot of new plugin development
initially (though we do plan to expand on ImageJ's multidimensional
visualization capabilities partially via plugins).

Another thing to be aware of is our sister project, Fiji, which has ImageJ
at its core but focuses on algorithm and plugin development?the goal is to
provide a single application that comes bundled with all the plugins
necessary to do scientific image processing. The Fiji developers are gearing
up for a proposal to the Google Summer of Code 2010 project (
http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/wiki/index.php/SoC_2010_Ideas), so one more
immediate option might be to propose your use case for that.

Dear John,

This is Kevin Eliceiri, Pi of the GO Grant funding the ImageJDev project. Curtis is right that our current funding is focused on the aims on the page, but I've had several meetings with NIH about additional ways to leverage ImageJ and there is great interest in having additional RFPs down the road that would leverage this great tool and add additional functionality and applications. There are some possibilities of pilot projects too to demonstrate the utility of new applications such as what you propose. I would be happy to discuss this more with you. 

best,
kevin
