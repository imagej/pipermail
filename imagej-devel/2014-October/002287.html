<PRE>Thanks for the articles!

I have more comments on the matter.  In fact, all types have the same
problem.  Even for a non-native ComplexType read and write would not be
atomic and thus not thread-safe.  The problem is that, for non-native
types, it is sufficient for multi-threaded code to synchronize on the
type instance itself.  For native types (e.g. ComplexDoubleType) and for
other proxy mechanisms such as Composites or ReadWriteConverters, this
doesn't work.  How about a getLock() (or getMonitor()) method as part of
Type whose purpose is to return a lock that enables synchronization on
that particular's type content.  Should that lock be constant for a
type's lifetime?  Proxy types for which access is atomic could return
themselves, just as Types that actually contain their content.

I like Tobias' proposal with a Hash of locks for NativeTypes, something
similar is necessary for other writable proxies.

Best,
Stephan
