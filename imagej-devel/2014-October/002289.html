<PRE>Hi Stephan,

I think it would be nice to have getLock() but I also think it will be rarely needed in practice.

We must be careful not to conflate two problems here:

The first one is that writes to e.g. ComplexType are not atomic and therefore strange things may happen if two ComplexTypes are used that actually refer to the same ComplexType pixel value in the image.
As Albert suggested, algorithms that need this feature need to take special care to synchronize access.
However, for many parallelizable algorithms this is not actually a problem. In most image-to-image operations (e.g. FFT, convolution, etc&#8230;) every output pixel is written only once by only one thread. Threads maybe read the same input pixels, but reading is fine.
The getLock() method would be a welcome addition for those algorithms that do not follow this pattern and need to synchronize.

The second problem is different. For BitType, writes to BitType pixels at different locations in the image may influence each other. And this should be avoided by default in my opinion.

I think: &#8220;You are safe as long as multiple threads write to different pixels&#8221; is a good contract to have.
Diverging from that with BitType, Unsigned12BitType, etc would add overhead for many algorithms that is in most cases not required (e.g. for FloatType, ComplexDoubleType, etc. the synchronization overhead would be wasted).

best regards,
Tobias
