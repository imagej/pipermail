<PRE>Hi Tobias,

I agree that the constraint is easier if the fraction reduces to an
integer.  However, it's not exactly the same for fraction=1 or
fraction&gt;1 either.  It would be great if we could identify a common
scheme that covers all cases without much interference.

Is may be a disk-based, memory cached CellImg the same thing as a
fractioned NativeImg?  Writing into different pixels in the same cell
may lead to confusing results when written to disk.

What about a method in RandomAccess that returns an `unsafe' interval
for its location?  Generally, that would be (1^n), in case of fraction
types, it would be the box surrounding all pixels served by the same
primitive type (which is horrible at the end of a row or cell-row where
pixels in the next row are affected), and in case of cached cells it
could be the cell.

With a method of this flavor, we can make educated decisions on
construction time of the multi-threaded code that, internally, would not
synchronize, i.e. be fast.

Best,
Stephan

</I>&gt;<i> As Albert suggested, algorithms that need this feature need to take special care to synchronize access.
</I>&gt;<i> However, for many parallelizable algorithms this is not actually a problem. In most image-to-image operations (e.g. FFT, convolution, etc&#8230;) every output pixel is written only once by only one thread. Threads maybe read the same input pixels, but reading is fine.
</I>&gt;<i> The getLock() method would be a welcome addition for those algorithms that do not follow this pattern and need to synchronize.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second problem is different. For BitType, writes to BitType pixels at different locations in the image may influence each other. And this should be avoided by default in my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think: &#8220;You are safe as long as multiple threads write to different pixels&#8221; is a good contract to have.
</I>&gt;<i> Diverging from that with BitType, Unsigned12BitType, etc would add overhead for many algorithms that is in most cases not required (e.g. for FloatType, ComplexDoubleType, etc. the synchronization overhead would be wasted).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for the articles!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have more comments on the matter.  In fact, all types have the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem.  Even for a non-native ComplexType read and write would not be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; atomic and thus not thread-safe.  The problem is that, for non-native
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; types, it is sufficient for multi-threaded code to synchronize on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type instance itself.  For native types (e.g. ComplexDoubleType) and for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other proxy mechanisms such as Composites or ReadWriteConverters, this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't work.  How about a getLock() (or getMonitor()) method as part of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Type whose purpose is to return a lock that enables synchronization on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that particular's type content.  Should that lock be constant for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type's lifetime?  Proxy types for which access is atomic could return
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; themselves, just as Types that actually contain their content.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I like Tobias' proposal with a Hash of locks for NativeTypes, something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; similar is necessary for other writable proxies.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; A na&#239;ve implementation of this technique could easily result in a very

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; The safest way to resolve this issue is to reinstate the lock-on-write

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; [..]

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; An alternative might be to give up lock-freedom in favor of wait-freedom

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hum, I do not if this is really a comparable situation, but it looks a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; lot like the double-checked locking (DCL) idiom, which is broken [1].
