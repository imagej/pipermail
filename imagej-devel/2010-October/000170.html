<PRE>Hi,

On Thu, 7 Oct 2010, Curtis Rueden wrote:

Good! That was my concern.

There are. But the most important is the lowest-level layer. And I think 
with what Grant did (based on my @parameter proof-of-concept), things are 
definitely moving into a good direction. Fiji (+plugins) will be very 
usable, even from other frameworks/libraries.

&gt;<i> &gt; Otherwise: impressive job.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the discussion served more to get us all on the same (or at 
</I>&gt;<i> least similar) page, and thinking about these topics, than it did to 
</I>&gt;<i> make any substantial design progress. We did settle on our priorities 
</I>&gt;<i> for the conference presentation, at least, so that is good.
</I>
I agree. The overall direction is definitely good (not that I would expect 
any project lead by you and Grant to go anywhere else...!)

Ciao,
Dscho
