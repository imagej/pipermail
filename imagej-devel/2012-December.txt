I agree that it would be good to have the code in the same repository, as
there will be shared code for both the IJ1 and the IJ2 plugin (and maybe
even for the Icy one?)

Thanks!

Thank you!

I forked it and opened a pull request to add the necessary dependencies to
the Maven project.

However, even with these added dependencies, I still miss the following
classes' sources:

	big.ij.snake2D.Snake2D;
	big.ij.snake2D.Snake2DKeeper;
	big.ij.snake2D.Snake2DNode;
	big.ij.snake2D.Snake2DScale;

When looking at the Fiji sources, I found classes of the same name, but in
a different package, included in the Snakuscule project. Sadly, they did
not do the job for me, as the isAlive() and updateStatus() methods want to
override a super class' methods but Snakuscule's Snake2D does not have
them. Likewise, Snakuscule's Snake2DKeeper's optimize() method's signature
disagrees with the call to said method in BIGSnake.

Would it be possible to include those sources, too?

Thanks,
Dscho

I do not know much about the EGit plugin (I always use command-line Git,
which comes more naturally to me given that I co-developed it), but my
guess is that it does not allow you to add the lib folder because Maven
wants versioned artifacts instead.

In any case, for re-usability and to prevent re-inventing the wheel, I
would much prefer to have the sources anyway ;-)

Thanks,
Johannes

Hi Ian,

When I wrote about my concerns with the Modulo approach last year, my goal
was to spark a technical discussion that could lead to a truly
N-dimensional solution in the OME schema. But that did not happen?the rest
of the team did not share my concerns?so the Modulo approach is AFAIK the
only way to store lifetime data within OMERO in the present day.

So it seems to me your best bet is to use Modulo, since that is what the
OMERO system provides, and hope that it stays well-supported in the long
term. The other option?proposing and implementing a truly N-dimensional
data model?would be something that only the core OMERO developers
realistically have the capability to do, given the complexity of the OMERO
software stack.

As for how LOCI will store spectral lifetime data in OMERO: we aren't
planning on doing so until the OME data model fully supports it. In the
meantime, it will be enough for us for Bio-Formats and ImageJ2 to support
it, since they are already N-dimensional.

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Curtis, Ian et al.

Thanks for raising this issue again.  We've certainly discussed it several times, on these lists and in our regular weekly meetings.  Fundamentally, Curtis is correct, we definitely need to address the issue of N-dimensional data thoroughly and completely.  This was the basis for the various studies we did of this problem in 2011/2012, the final summaries of which are:

http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/file-formats/working-with-ome-xml/6d-7d-and-8d-storage

http://trac.openmicroscopy.org/ome/wiki/WorkPlan/NDimensionalData
(deprecated page)

Curtis stated he didn't like the Modulo solution, and frankly, from a modelling point of view, we're not fond of that either.   We fully appreciate the limitations of the approach.  As detailed above, however, the approach does allow us to move forward, begin to explore these different data types, and start to work with real applications in a broad number of domains, and allow us to develop knowledge and experience with new data types and their usage.  That provides the foundation for a significant re-design of essentially all of OME's models and software.  Given the number of people who depend on these resources, we need to initiate large breaking changes when we are sure of what we are doing, and have good example datasets from as wide variety domains as possible.  For this reason, we previously decided to provide Ian and other with this type of multi-dimensional data with support for a Modulo-based approach, help get their analysis integrated with OME's tool, and then get, for example, global analysis on FLIM data running in production.

This does put off the inevitable, and we fully accept the additional burden this creates.  However, we are committed to making significant changes to OME's APIs through a series of defined, known steps, where people working with OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats and OMERO are provided explicit, well-documented, working specifications and examples, are allowed to transition to a new framework.

Frankly, the other issue is that there are a large number of critical things to achieve in OME.  For a number of years, many institutions have insisted that we provide support for direct access to data from the filesystem, improved support for analysis, export, etc.  To do each of these correctly takes significant work and concentration by the whole team to deliver functionality across the whole stack.  That means we have to make strategic decisions, and choose our priorities.  We don't have infinite resources, but what we do build and release has to be of high quality and usability.

Finally, discussions of N-dim will certainly continue to appear on the weekly team meeting agenda (https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/community/minutes/conference-calls/2012).  Those meetings can also be used for more detailed, focussed conversations.

Thanks for the thoughtful comments;  look forward to more.

Cheers,

Jason

Actually I oversimplified as our code is a Matlab GUI wrapping cross-platform c++ fitting code so bringing this together with slim may be relatively easy as the 2 GUIs seem to have a lot of common features.

In the shorter term I think we need to use the same strategy to store data in OMERO.

Clearly you have a better feel for the downsides of the ModuloAlong? solution than we do so can I ask how you intend to store your data in OMERO?

I want to draw your attention to some very similar work we are doing within ImageJ:
    http://loci.wisc.edu/software/slim-plugin

The SLIM Plugin is an ImageJ plugin (written in Java, of course), which uses the SLIM-curve library (written in cross-platform C) to perform the curve fitting (of TCSPC data).

Perhaps GlobalProcessing and SLIM-curve could join forces? It is much easier to access C code from Java than MATLAB code, but there are clearly features in GlobalProcessing missing from SLIM-curve (e.g., wide-field), and vice versa.

> 1) We intend to standardise on encoding FLIM data using ModuloAlongT.

Personally, I dislike ModuloAlongT, especially as a long-term solution. There are certain dimension orders that are simply impossible using it (e.g., XYbCZT, where "b" is lifetime bins, and T is actual time points). I would much favor us developing a true N-dimensional OME data model, and using that, moving forward.

I agree that this functionality would work well as a Bio-Formats reader.

Hi!

I am still having difficulties with the latest Fiji (both w/w/out jre) and 
LOCI. Receiving same errors as described above.

As of now I am unable to import files with LOCI, no matter which loci-jar 
is deleted or not...

Have I magically jinxed my Fiji folder (again) or is this a problem shared 
by others?

Awesome work btw, Johannes (:

Hi Jonas,

> deleted or not...

I updated Fiji with the 4.4.5 release of Bio-Formats last night, so these
errors are almost certainly my fault.

Unfortunately, I am unable to replicate the problem. I tried updating an
existing Fiji on another workstation, and all worked fine (though I did
have to click "break the dependency" in response to one prompt). I also
tried with a fresh continuous release downloaded from fiji.sc just now, and
it also worked.

If you run Help > Update Fiji, click on Advanced mode, what do you see for
"Locally modified files" and "Uninstalled files only"? A fully up-to-date
Fiji should not have any entries.

Hi Jonas,

My sincerest apologies for the pain. It is almost certainly due to problems
on the update site, not your configuration.

I have updated the Bio-Formats installation in Fiji to the absolute latest
available, and hopefully ironed out these problems. Can you please run Help
> Update Fiji to install all the updates, and let me know if Bio-Formats
becomes functional for you?

Thanks,
Curtis

Hi Pierre,

Sorry for the trouble.

I was able to launch the 2.0.0-beta5 release on Win7 64-bits from a fresh
download off the web site. However, after updating, I had the same problem
you describe: the splash screen appeared, disappeared, and then ImageJ
never comes up.

I tracked down the issue to a problem with the latest JARs on the update
site. I have now fixed the problem. If you download a fresh 2.0.0-beta5,
and then run the updater, all should be well.

Regards,
Curtis

P.S. If a fresh 2.0.0-beta5 doesn't work, please verify that you have Java
installed. ImageJ2 is not yet bundled with a Java runtime.

Hi there,

I have a working version of Fiji running at home (where I'm at now) and
don't dare to break it, but I sat at work all day today pulling my hair - I
could not make it work.

I tried fresh downloads (fiji with and without jre), I tried removing one
LOCI-jar, then the other, then both. I tried updating both fiji and imagej
in two seperate clean setups, and also tried repeating updates to make sure
no more components where awaiting updates.

It could be that the java-install is not entirely stable/up-to-date - it's
running JRE6. Haven't tried 7.

I have no clue. Working from home tomorrow where it's safe & stable!

Sincerely,
Jonas

Please don't apologize for providing me with tools for science (;
I will try it out first thing tomorrow. Pretty much done with developing,
now it's time for analysis (:

Besides, I like a challenge - although I have to admit this time I was in
over my head.

Oh, by the way, I'm not sure if the Maven dependencies are all sorted with
regards to a certain Jama package... It looks for version 1.0.2 whereas the
latest release is 1.0.3 so it cannot be found... I managed to get it
working through manually installing 1.0.2. It also works by changing the
pom files of VIB-lib, VIB_ and 3D_viewer making them up to date. Having
said that I only have a faintest clue of the infrastructure of Maven
repositories...

Anyway, it didn't help me with my loci (;

Sincerely,
Jonas

Hi Jonas,

> java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 0 must not be null and positive.

That is actually great news. It means we fixed the problem with the update
site. Now there is most likely a bona fide bug in Bio-Formats.

Would you be willing to send us a problematic dataset, so that we can
address the issue? You can use Fiji's Help > Upload Sample Image feature to
send it if is smaller than ~250MB.

But first, just to be sure: please run Help > Update Fiji and make sure it
says your Fiji is fully up to date, with no locally modified files.

Thanks,
Curtis

Hi,

Now all is good!
Thanks a ton and more.

I uploaded a sample image (seq1615.jp2) anyway for testing (but where did

Sincerely,

Hi Jonas,

> I uploaded a sample image (seq1615.jp2) anyway for testing

Thanks, I tested on my system. It prints a warning "Expected positive value
for PhysicalSizeZ; got 0.0" but the image window opens.

Other Bio-Formats devs: can you reproduce?

> (but where did it go?)

Files uploaded using that mechanism are placed on the Fiji web server (
fiji.sc) in a private folder; we assume you do not want your data shared
publicly unless you say otherwise.

Regards,
Curtis

Yes, and that is the correct behavior.  So far as I can see from opening
the file in Nikon's Elements software, this file contains no physical
size/calibration information.  Bio-Formats is simply warning that a
physical pixel size of 0 was found, which means that it will not be
preserved if you were to convert the file to some other format (only
values greater than 0 are preserved).

As long as Jonas is able to see the image in Fiji and there is truly no
physical pixel size, this is not a bug.

Regards,
-Melissa

Hi all,
I'm getting pretty far along with the CellProfiler integration and I'm
at the point where I'd like to get a headless ImageJ context. My first
guess was that I should call imagej.ImageJ.createContext() with a list
containing only the ConsoleService.  The list (see below) has most of
what I want (module service, command service, dataset service, display
service), but is missing a few others (overlay service and scripting
service). I've been running ImageJ with the DefaultUIService while
running CellProfiler with a UI and it seems to operate pretty smoothly -
some error messages when it can't find viewers for displays, but
otherwise without any apparent UI interaction.

So my first question is how should I start ImageJ headless and my second
question is "how headless is headless?" (will it ever touch AWT? Will it
exclude the legacy layer?).

Created service: imagej.thread.DefaultThreadService
Created service: imagej.event.DefaultEventService
Created service: imagej.plugin.DefaultPluginService
Created service: imagej.module.DefaultModuleService
Created service: imagej.command.DefaultCommandService
Created service: imagej.options.DefaultOptionsService
Created service: imagej.event.DefaultStatusService
Created service: imagej.object.DefaultObjectService
Created service: imagej.data.DefaultDatasetService
Created service: imagej.io.DefaultIOService
Created service: imagej.display.DefaultDisplayService

I agree, but what I meant was that from his prior message, it sounded like
he was getting an exception:

> java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 0 must not be null and positive.

So by my vague question "can you reproduce?" I actually meant "can you

>From your mail, it sounds like you see the same behavior as me: a
relatively harmless warning, rather than exception that prevents the image
window from appearing.

Jonas: Did you double check that your Fiji is 100% up to date? Help >
Update Fiji, no "locally modified" or "local-only" files at all? And if so,
do you still receive an exception?

Hey again!

Sorry I wasn't clear in the previous message - all really is good.

After running last updates I can import all my images fine. I just uploaded
the sample image so you could reproduce if you wanted to look further into
what was causing it *before* I ran the update.

Sincerely,
JonasD

Hi Lee,

> how should I start ImageJ headless

It sounds like you want a full-featured ImageJ context with all available
services except for maybe a couple of them (the ones that touch AWT).

The easiest way to ensure your ImageJ context is headless is to exclude
problematic JARs from your distribution completely. Specifically: do not
include ij-legacy or any of the ij-ui-* UI implementations (e.g.,
ij-ui-swing).

Then you can create an ImageJ context simply with "new imagej.ImageJ()"
(note that this invocation changed a couple of days ago from the previous
static "imagej.ImageJ.createContext()" but it is otherwise the same).

If for some reason you need or want to include those problematic JARs in
your classpath, you can still avoid the ImageJ context including them by
passing an explicit list of services to the ImageJ constructor. Or, if you
would rather approach it from an "exclusion" rather than "inclusion"
standpoint, you could do something like:

  final PluginIndex pluginIndex = new PluginIndex();
  pluginIndex.discover();
  final List<PluginInfo<Service>> services = pluginIndex.getPlugins(Service.
class);

And then cherry-picking everything from the list that doesn't violate your
exclusion rules.

For that latter approach though, we should probably provide some helper
routine somewhere to make this easier; if you take a look at
ServiceHelper#findServiceClasses, you'll see the code, but it's currently
private. We could make that a public static utility method for you instead.
Or provide something even higher level.

> how headless is headless?

Ideally, we want headless to truly mean no usage of AWT whatsoever. That
said, we do violate that rule in one big place right now: the
ThreadService. The DefaultThreadService uses java.awt.EventQueue to queue
and invoke operations. With a normal JVM with java.awt.headless=true, this
is unlikely to cause problems. But if it does for some reason, you could
provide your own ThreadService implementation with a higher priority than
that of DefaultThreadService, and the ImageJ service loader will
automagically use it instead.

Regards,
Curtis

Thanks, Curtis, I'll take a look at the different strategies. Picking 
and choosing .jars is probably not so bad. Hopefully I can exclude a 
couple key ones and everything will work.

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Legacy Mode work
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1212182311330.3192@bonsai2>

Hi Barry & Curtis,

with great satisfaction I report that the Legacy Mode branch has reached a
beta stage. That is, I consider this functionality to be at a stage where
we can include it in a beta version.

Sadly, I did not manage to think of a way to test this functionality
automatically yet, mainly because most of it is purely in the GUI: images
shown in IJ2 will be hidden and the IJ1 ImageWindows displayed when
switching to the legacy mode, and vice versa when switching back.

It is all in the 'legacy' branch, and I would appreciate a good look-over
by both of you.

The menu item it adds is in Help>Start ImageJ 1.x Legacy Mode, and when
you switch to that mode, you will get a Help>Stop ImageJ 1.x Legacy Mode
in the ImageJ 1.x GUI.

There is one commit that is reverted right away, this is the change I
intended originally to make it possible to have multiple legacy services
running in parallel. Alas, it interferes with normal operation; you would
not be able to instantiate an ImagePlus and pass it to the legacy service,
since your class loader and the legacy service's class loader would have
incompatible versions of the ImagePlus *class*. The reason why I left it
in was for education and to remember what did not work, so that I would
keep thinking of better ways.

Once that legacy mode is in, and robust, I plan to integrate it into Fiji
by adding the "Stop Legacy Mode" as a Help>Try ImageJ2 or some such.

Ciao & merry Christmas,
Dscho

Hi all,
I'm trying to get Ricard's ESnake plugin for ImageJ2 built
(https://github.com/RicardDelgado/active-cells-ij2.git). The .jar file
produced by running Maven doesn't have a META-INF/annotations path in
it. I can't seem to figure out the magic (or in this case, lack of
magic) that puts it there.

Also, what I'm really looking for is an example ImageJ2 plugin - I want
to make sure I can add a plugins directory and any .jars inside to my
classpath and they will be properly detected.

Lee & I discussed in chat, and the issues were two-fold:

1) The current master branch of active-cells-ij2 had some problems with the
POM. These have been remedied, and a pull request filed, here:
    https://github.com/RicardDelgado/active-cells-ij2/pull/2

2) Lee was trying to build the project from Eclipse, which has its own
issues with annotation processing (which is what creates the
META-INF/annotations, using SezPoz). The aforementioned PR also corrects
that issue by adding the requisite additional configuration files for
Eclipse.

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Dscho,

Thanks for the update; that is great news. Barry & I did some testing, and
found a few issues, but given the time constraints we are going to go ahead
with the beta6 release this week.

One big issue I found is that ImageDisplays that originate in IJ2 land
(e.g., from File > Open) do not get translated to IJ1 mode unless you
execute a legacy command on them first. That is, more generally, the
command for switching to legacy mode apparently does not explicitly invoke
any IJ2<->IJ1 synchronization, meaning they can be out of sync with ImageJ1.

I took a look at adding some sort of legacyService.sync() call, but the
LegacyService API still needs work. Currently there is a lot of logic
taking place in LegacyCommand.LegacyCommandThread.run(), which should
ultimately get factored out to be more accessible from the LegacyService
itself. But that work will have to wait until after the holidays.

So anyway, we will note this limitation in the release announcement, for
now.

Another problem which I would like to see fixed before release is that on
OS X, when starting up ImageJ2 now, there is a VerifyError with class
MacAdapter that was not previously present. I hope to track this down
tomorrow morning and fix before cutting the release.

Thanks again for your efforts on this, safe travels, and happy holidays!

Good point, I forgot to test that.

It is probably some addition to LegacyImageMap#toggleLegacyMode(boolean)
to make sure all known ImagePlus instances are shown.

Will have a look during the flight.

I think I know what it is. Left over from some previous iteration.

See you on the other side!

I did work on that. The only problem I had during testing was that at some
stage, the x and y axes would not be found, so the PixelProbe threw
exceptions abound. After a while, that was fixed, though. Probably some
performance issue preventing things from being harmonized quickly enough.

BTW I just saw that Jenkins is not happy, it thinks that legacy tests are
failing. But when I ran mvn locally ("mvn clean test"), things worked!

Yep, it was that issue: I added special handling for "$service" in the
CodeHacker so that I could easily change the method how the LegacyService
is discovered for use in the javassisted functions, but I forgot one.

FWIW I pushed my stuff to the 'legacy' branch, but the commits were
designed to be patched into the branch ;-) I'll work a bit more on the
commit messages.

For the moment, I will have to refrain from working on the Jenkins issue
and from trying to resolve my ImgLib issues because my internet connection
is too slow... :-(

Ciao,
Dscho

A rather critical error, it turns out... After my patches, all javassisted
functions assume that a legacy service exists. I will fix this.

Hi Dscho,

Thanks, let us know when you feel the branch is ready to go.

By the way, one version of the legacy branch, which included an additional
commit by me, was already merged to master. But since you have now
force-pushed that branch, sorting out the final merge to master is going to
be a little bit tricky. But at worst we can just revert the previous merge
and then cherry pick my extra commit.

Since I am home with kids in a snowstorm, I will probably not be very
available today, but it sounds like there is a bit more to be done on the
legacy branch anyway. If you run out of time, let us know and bdezonia & I
will take it from there!

Regards,
Curtis

No problem, I saw that you merged already and adjusted the commit message
already.

Sorting out the test failure right now.

Thanks for the offer! I realized that I did not live up to my own standard
yesterday, unable to finalize the work I promised to finish.

Hopefully I manage to get the Jenkins failures sorted out (it looks as if
the tests fail only on the Jenkins server, Maven's completely happy on
this here netbook). If not, I will actually come back to your generous
offer!

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] ImageJ netbeans plugin development...
Message-ID: <1DA0CE11-20B2-482C-8F8B-AD58B70A167D@gaiag.net>

I have set up Netbeans for ImageJ plugin development, but I am getting some errors that seem to imply that the version of ImageJ in the repository is not the latest.   For example,  the line 

IJ.setThreshold(imj, 1.0, 255.0);

gives the error:

no suitable method found for setThreshold(ImagePlus,double,double)

and the line

imageRoi.setZeroTransparent(true);

gives the error:

cannot find symbol: method setZeroTransparent(boolean)

The Netbeans output gives the error:

Failed to execute goal on project ij-app: Could not resolve dependencies for project net.imagej:ij-app:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT: Failed to collect dependencies for [net.imagej:ij-core:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (compile), net.imagej:ij-io:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (compile), net.imagej:ij-ui:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (compile), net.java.sezpoz:sezpoz:jar:1.9 (compile), net.imagej:ij-commands-app:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-commands-data:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-commands-debug:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-commands-display:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-commands-misc:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-legacy:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-options:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-script-beanshell:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-script-java:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-ui-swing-script-editor:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-platforms:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-tools:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-ui-swing:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-ui-swing-commands:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-ui-swing-tools:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-ui-swing-updater:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), net.imagej:ij-updater-ssh:jar:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (runtime), org.swinglabs:swing-layout:jar:1.0.3 (compile), imagej:ij:jar:2.0-SNAPSHOT (compile)]: Failed to read artifact descriptor for mpicbg:imglib:jar:2.0-SNAPSHOT: Failure to find net.imglib2:pom-imglib:pom:2.0-SNAPSHOT in http://maven.imagej.net/content/repositories/releases was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of imagej.releases has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1]

Message-ID: <CADN69ykSmp00xV0k7Q+fAkiZ8VjxhBQRkCwDvgXbUWogAkQFzA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I cut the release for ImageJ 2.0.0-beta6 today, including ImgLib2 [1, 2],
SCIFIO [3, 4] and ImageJ2 [5, 6]. (It would have been ideal to use an
existing SCIFIO release rather than cutting one specifically for ImageJ2,
but the ImageJ2 codebase now uses SCIFIO's 4.5 development branch, and
there is no 4.5.x release yet.)

Later tonight or tomorrow I will update the ImageJ update site and web
site, and announce on the ImageJ user list.

Happy holidays, all!

Regards,
Curtis

Thank you so much! I meant to write a mail that I fixed a couple of legacy
mode issues including those you mentioned on #imagejdev. BTW Aivar was
correct in his assessment why I chose the naming of the menu items, but
since you seem to not mind the shorter name, my rationale is moot!

(It would have been ideal to use an existing SCIFIO release rather than cutting one specifically for ImageJ2, but the ImageJ2 codebase now uses SCIFIO&#39;s 4.5 development branch, and there is no 4.5.x release yet.)

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] ImageJ 2.0.0-beta6 released
Message-ID: <CADN69ynDV2itc-mYgmCjk1WRiSJYL79R50i5oVjtLO6H++ZCHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

The ImageJDev team has released the sixth beta of ImageJ2, version 2.0.0-
beta6.

ImageJ 2.0.0-beta6 is a "beta"-quality release, meaning the code is not
finished. The design is more stable than before but still subject to change
until the final 2.0.0 release. It is recommended that people continue to
use ImageJ v1.x for critical work.

The ImageJ2 user interface is modeled after ImageJ v1.x as much as
possible. However, under the hood, ImageJ2 is a complete redesign of
ImageJ. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ by
bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between "legacy" and "modern"
image structures.

Development of this release of ImageJ focused on improved legacy support.
In particular, ImageJ2 now allows you to switch to a dedicated "legacy
mode" for maximum compatibility with ImageJ1.

For further details on this release, including a discussion of new
features, please see our blog post:
  http://developer.imagej.net/2012/12/27/imagej-v200-beta6

You can download the release from:
  http://developer.imagej.net/downloads

To more accurately reflect what is left to do, we have again reestimated
ImageJ2's release dates, and scheduled additional betas before the final 2.0
.0 release. See the Downloads page for the updated table of planned future
releases and roadmap links for the project. The focus of the next release (
2.0.0-beta7) is on robust core support for N-dimensional data, including
very large image data, and data/display decoupling.

For more details on the ImageJ developments, see the web site at:
  http://developer.imagej.net/

Lastly, please note most of the ImageJ development team will be away for
the next 1-2 weeks, back in early January. So we may be a bit slow
responding to mails until then.

Regards and happy holidays,
Curtis Rueden
