<PRE>Hi Jay &amp; Erwin,

&gt;<i> Erwin and I are exploring the idea of a new version of JEX that would
</I>&gt;<i> itself be a plugin of ImageJ.
</I>
That would be fantastic.

&gt;<i> There are a few different ways this could be developed... Either as
</I>&gt;<i> part of the imagej managed code base (i.e. a package within a current
</I>&gt;<i> ImageJ2 project or as its own maven project that is updated and
</I>&gt;<i> managed like the rest of the ImageJ2 suite of projects like ij-app,
</I>&gt;<i> ij-core, etc.) or as a completely separate project that we jarify and
</I>&gt;<i> allow users to put into the plugin folder of ImageJ afterward.
</I>
The model we are targeting is &quot;one Git repository per JAR file&quot; with each
being a Maven module with its own version. We have already completed this
transition with the Fiji project [1], and ImageJ2 will be completely
structured that way soon as well. This approach has many advantages:

1) Stable release version couplings between components, so that if an
upstream component changes, downstream components are not affected/broken
until they intentionally upgrade to the newer version.

2) Independent versioning of each component. When a bug is fixed in a
particular component, we just release a new version of that component. No
need to cut vacuous releases of the entire collection of ImageJ2 JARs.

3) Easier and less intimidating to contribute to an individual plugin: just
fork that one repo, push your changes and file a PR. No need to clone an
all-encompassing fiji.git or imagej.git repository.

Further, in the Fiji project, each module is now what we call an &quot;external
plugin&quot; that lives in its own repository, either in the
github.com/fijinamespace, or in some cases [2, 3] in the plugin
developer's personal space
(doesn't matter that much).

ImageJ2 and Fiji support multiple update sites [4]. There is a core ImageJ2
update site [5], a core Fiji update site [6], and many others as well [7].
JEX would be a perfect fit for its own update site, giving you full control
over every aspect of your releases while leveraging the power of ImageJ2
for deployment to your users.

In short: I would suggest creating a personal update site for JEX and
serving your releases from there. That way, anyone using ImageJ2 or Fiji
can install JEX simply by checking a box. For details, see:

    <A HREF="http://fiji.sc/How_to_set_up_and_populate_an_update_site">http://fiji.sc/How_to_set_up_and_populate_an_update_site</A>

And as you know I would certainly advise structuring JEX as a Maven
project, though it is not required. Here is a template you can use as a
starting point:

Very happy to answer any questions our issues you have on your journey. :-)

Curtis
