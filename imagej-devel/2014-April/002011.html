<PRE>Hi guys,

I definitely see the need to fix ImgLib2 core for a release, but that really did not change much recently I feel -- maybe we finally need to define what the core should actually be, we started with that on the hackathon in Madison but never really finished.

I support Tobias's position, I have only used ImgLib2 recently, not done any development on it. So he has a much better perspective on it than I have. I am happy to discuss it with Tobias in detail when I am in Dresden in two weeks. We have to do software integration anyways.

Cheers,
Steffi

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The idea being to have a Maven plugin that eliminates tediousness in various ways.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, developing this infrastructure cannot be our priority before June 1.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My fear with splitting subprojects is that this will make it harder to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consistently refactor across subprojects, (or clean up behind commits
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that don't), see this discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://github.com/imglib/imglib/pull/23">https://github.com/imglib/imglib/pull/23</A> (last 10 messages or so). How
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can we pull this off consistently?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is a fair concern. However, as long as all affected projects are open in Eclipse, and coupled with project couplings at the time, the refactoring will cover everything. If someone does a refactoring while excluding a downstream project, the easiest solution I know to &quot;fix it&quot; later is to check out the old version of the code prior to performing the refactoring and reperform it with the project linkage in place this time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also I image that we will require quite a bit more of &quot;git logistics&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with split projects. For example, assume that I want to make a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; topic branch that touches more than one subproject (which easily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happens when refactoring).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is actually a larger concern to me. However, it comes down to how mature the project is. When you are in the incubation phase (pre-release), then these refactorings are common, and SNAPSHOT couplings with a multi-module Maven project are desirable. However, once you become released and stable, there is an increased need to maintain backwards compatibility. In that case, you really want to *avoid* those sorts of refactorings in the future. I mean sure, you can do them, but you must also maintain backwards compatibility, meaning that you leave the old API there too (often @Deprecated). In that common scenario, you probably actually want to alter only one project at a time, then make sure the changes in a &quot;low-level&quot; project like imglib2 core do not adversely affect downstream &quot;higher-level&quot; projects such as imglib2-realtransform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How will Jenkins deal with this decoupled situation: I will merge my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; topic branches into master in each of the subprojects sequentially.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This will produce a lot of failing intermediate builds in Jenkins,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, because each component is pinned to release versions of other components. So changing master of one component will have no effect on the Jenkins builds of other components. You would need to do a release of component A, then update component B's dependency to the new version of A, before the Jenkins build would be affected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is useful locally to pin a bunch of components together temporarily using SNAPSHOTs. But you never want that pin to make it onto the master branch, or else the build will be irreproducible. So one of our goals is to make it as easy as possible to toggle your local developer configuration between release and snapshot couplings, while simultaneously making it as difficult as possible to accidentally commit and push code that uses or requires the SNAPSHOT bindings to work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How about doing decoupled versions without splitting up the git
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; repository? It seems to me that this would be an easy way to avoid the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; downsides mentioned before.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would avoid some of them, and cause others...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One more thing: If you want to bring imglib core out of beta, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should probably do a clean-up. There are things that are in core now,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would not consider ready for release (ROIs come to mind). So either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we live with rapidly growing major version numbers due to frequent API
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; breaks (fine with me) or split out the not-quite-ready parts into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their own subprojects (also fine with me).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is not a matter of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when&quot;. We simply cannot leave ImgLib2 in beta forever. That said, ImgLib2 does not need to be released before ImageJ 2.0.0's June 1 deadline, because that deadline has very limited scope. The new N-dimensional data model is not included with that. But we will need to bite the bullet eventually, possibly even later this year...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either we live with rapidly growing major version numbers due to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; frequent API breaks (fine with me)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To a limited extent I am also fine with that. But I think we should impose a limit; e.g., &quot;no more than one major release bump per year&quot; or some such. Ideally much less often, if ever. Keep in mind that in a highly extensible framework like ImageJ, every breaking change can have enormous disruptive consequences. The fact that ImgLib2 is not stable and released with a guaranteed-not-to-break-later API has surely stunted its adoption. We can discuss and refine more as the projects continue to mature.

</I>&gt;<i> Curtis

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> API enhancements, API-breaking major new developments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As always, Curtis &amp; I are ready to help with all of that stuff, in
