</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Barry
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; early last year you have contacted Antti Niemist&#246; about his HistThresh
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; toolbox [1]. This was a Matlab toolbox for image thresholding which he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; released under GPLv2+. In the mailing list, he agreed to release it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; under BSD for ImageJ2 development.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately, it appears that he no longer works at the Tampere
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; University of Technology and the website for the project has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; taken down. His previous email address has also been cancelled and I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; couldn't find his new contact. I tried to use wayback machine to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; salvage his project, but the last backup [2] was before the last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; release (he made one release prompted by your email which fixed a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; couple of bugs in the minimum and maximum likelihood method). I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; made a github repository with the version I found [3]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I made an Octave port which works fine for me [4] but I know some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Matlab users who would like to use it. Would you happen to have made a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; backup of the last release he made?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks in advance,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Carn&#235;

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Barry, Carn&#235;,
</I>&gt;<i> This is the only version I have of the maximum likelihood estimator
</I>&gt;<i> (th_maxlik.m) code from Anti's website. The date of the file in my computer is
</I>&gt;<i> 2/Nov/2004.
</I>&gt;<i> His method uses the th_minimum.m procedure as a first approximation, which in
</I>&gt;<i> turn uses the bimodtest.m and others (also attached), but in my endeavours of
</I>&gt;<i> porting the th_maxlik method in Java for IJ I failed miserably in reproducing
</I>&gt;<i> the results that the code gave for matlab (shown in the pdf attached).
</I>&gt;<i> I spent some time with this particular method trying to resolve what was the
</I>&gt;<i> issue, but I never succeeded, so rather than having a broken method, I left it
</I>&gt;<i> our from the autothreshold plugin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope it is useful.
</I>
Thank you all.

I have finally managed to contact the original author, Antti Niemist&#246;,
who sent me all the files. For future reference, I changed the
repository mentioned before [3], using the exact files he sent me,
including both versions. I added a note to the README file about the
ImageJ ports.

Carn&#235;
