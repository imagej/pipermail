<PRE>Hi all,

To follow up on this old thread:

&gt;<i> &quot;What is SciJava, and what is ImageJ?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The intuition that appeals to me is: if it is image-specific, it is
</I>&gt;<i> part of ImageJ. And if it is more general, it lives in SciJava.
</I>
Earlier this week, we completed a refactoring of the ImageJ2 component
structure in line with this intuition:

* <A HREF="https://github.com/imagej">https://github.com/imagej</A> -- contains components specific to image
processing.
* <A HREF="https://github.com/scijava">https://github.com/scijava</A> -- contains foundation components which are
*not* specific to images.

Each component lives in its own Git repository as a single-module Maven
project, with release version couplings to other components.

The ImageJ2 application is now made up of the following core components:

* imagej-common -- the core ImageJ library and data model built on ImgLib2
* imagej-ops -- the framework for extensible image processing algorithms
announced earlier this month
* imagej-updater -- the famous ImageJ Updater which keeps people up-to-date
* imagej-launcher -- the command line executable for launching ImageJ
* imagej-legacy -- the glue component providing backwards compatibility
with ImageJ 1.x
* scijava-common -- the core library for non-image-processing-specific
logic, including the plugin mechanism, application container, and module
framework

ImageJ2 also includes the following optional plugin components:

* imagej-plugins-commands -- built-in commands (i.e., most of the ImageJ
menu structure)
* imagej-plugins-tools -- built-in tools (i.e., the toolbar buttons)
* imagej-plugins-uploader-* -- plugins for the ImageJ Updater which make it
possible to upload to ImageJ update sites
* imagej-ui-swing -- the &quot;modern&quot; ImageJ2 user interface
* scijava-plugins-platforms -- platform-specific logic (stuff like &quot;how do
I open a web browser on OS X?&quot;)
* scijava-plugins-text-* -- plugins for rendering text formats like Markdown
* scripting-* -- plugins for the various scripting languages: Beanshell,
Clojure, etc.

More details at:
<A HREF="http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-daily/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/site/dependencies.html">http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-daily/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/site/dependencies.html</A>

Lastly, a couple of comments relating to earlier messages in this thread:

* We decided not to split imagej-ops in half.
* The ij-core module and scripting code was thus migrated to scijava-common.

We aim to release a new ImageJ2 beta by the end of this week.

Regards,
Curtis

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   -- I strongly considered that, but instead I think it fits perfectly

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the OPS framework
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, but I would suggest doing that later, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * imagej-ops image processing ops -&gt; stay in imagej-ops
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   -- these ops are image-specific, and depend on ImgLib2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That makes absolute sense (as the above), but I would like to focus on
</I>&gt;<i> using ij-ops first. Traditionally, it has been much easier to develop a
</I>&gt;<i> fast-moving project when it is maintained in a single repository.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * imagej-ops widgets -&gt; stay in imagej-ops
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   -- and move Swing-specific code into ij-ui-swing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that probably needs to happen sooner rather than later because the
</I>&gt;<i> technical debt incurred by mixing UI with processing can be a huge pain in
</I>&gt;<i> the back side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * ij-core scripting framework -&gt; scijava-scripting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   -- scripting support is not image-specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * ij-scripting-* -&gt; scijava-scripting-*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   -- each of these has different, often very large, dependencies
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that this is a good plan, but again, I would love to see this
</I>&gt;<i> happening later. Preferably after switching Fiji to the ImageJ2 script
</I>&gt;<i> editor because I see a couple of architectural questions looming for us;
</I>&gt;<i> These architectural issues are much easier solved when all involved code
</I>&gt;<i> lives in the same repository.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * other ij-core unrelated stuff -&gt; think more; consider case-by-case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   -- maybe some goes to scijava-common...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   -- would be nice if the &quot;ij-core&quot; module could completely go away
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whoa. Radical food for thought. But I begin to see your reasoning and to
</I>&gt;<i> agree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know that such changes would rock the boat... again. But before we get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; too much farther along I would like to have a very clear, sensible policy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which answers the question: &quot;What is SciJava, and what is ImageJ?&quot; And I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think the structure above would do that, and be a really strong
</I>&gt;<i> foundation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the next decade at least.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Makes sense. How about revisiting the split in two weeks? We could even
</I>&gt;<i> call it milestone 0.2.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ciao,
</I>&gt;<i> Dscho
