Hi Johannes,

&gt;<i> Almost correct. The file extensions accepted are dependent on the
</I>&gt;<i> top-level directory. In plugins/ for example, .class, .jar, .ijm and
</I>&gt;<i> script extensions are allowed, but not .lut. In luts/, only .lut are
</I>&gt;<i> allowed. In lib/ (which you did not mention), there is no limitation on
</I>&gt;<i> file extensions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This restrictions are not for dictatorship reasons, BTW, but to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> surprises from incorrect usage of the updater.
</I>Ok, that makes sense. I didn't mention lib/ because it isn't in a fresh
Fiji install. Is it deprecated, or is it sticking around?

After that I got a little confused... Just to talk this out so I'm not
missing something.

&gt;&gt;<i> Am I correct? What I was attempting was to push a 1-2 bash script that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was just &quot;ImageJ-linux64 --all-my-special-args...&quot; and having no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extension or .sh didn't take.
</I>&gt;<i> Bash scripts cannot be executed by ImageJ, hence it does not make too much
</I>&gt;<i> sense for the updater to ship them. Having said that, you could upload
</I>&gt;<i> them into, say, lib/.
</I>
Couldn't you say the same thing about Fiji shipping with a .desktop
file? It's an analogous situation I think. We just want to make it easy
to launch Fiji in a certain way.

&gt;&gt;<i> I can think of several workarounds, the most obvious is to create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Fiji.app/scripts/mything.bsh where I guess the worst that could happen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is someone tries to run it as a beanshell script.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a better way to do this? I can also think of other use cases
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> besides this specific one.
</I>&gt;<i> It is a very dangerous thing to let random people specify the way you run
</I>&gt;<i> things, therefore my suggested way would be to ship the Bash scripts
</I>&gt;<i> separately to the users (so they know they are from a trusted source, and
</I>&gt;<i> so they know to to complain to when their Windows machine has no clue how
</I>&gt;<i> to run Bash scripts).
</I>Maybe I should say that nothing I'm talking about is forced on the
user.  They could still run our plugin from the plugins menu like
normal. Putting a .sh file in lib/ sounds like the best option and we
don't have to use an incorrect extension.  Thanks for pointing that out.

Happy New Year,
Collin
