<PRE>Hi all,

I haven't been able to find this in the docs, but I was wondering what
the Fiji (or is it IJ2 now?) updater can push to a 3rd party update site.

Poking around I think that only some directories will be looked at:
Fiji.app/plugins/
Fiji.app/luts/
Fiji.app/jars/
Fiji.app/macros/
Fiji.app/scripts/

And only file types:
.class/.jar
.lut
.txt
appropriate macro/script extensions (.ijm, .py, .rb, etc)

Am I correct? What I was attempting was to push a 1-2 bash script that
was just &quot;ImageJ-linux64 --all-my-special-args...&quot; and having no
extension or .sh didn't take.

I can think of several workarounds, the most obvious is to create
Fiji.app/scripts/mything.bsh where I guess the worst that could happen
is someone tries to run it as a beanshell script.

Is there a better way to do this? I can also think of other use cases
besides this specific one.

Thanks,
Collin
