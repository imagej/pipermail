Thanks!

</I>
Okay. But please, do not use the Median for measuring the performance. All
you are doing is to confuse the benchmark with noise: the theoretically
optimal runtime can really not be measured in multi-process environments,
but at least we know that it can only be reached, never succeeded. For
that reason, best-of-5 is a well-established technique to measure
performance. (By necessity, the Median will be a worse approximation to
the time you would like to determine than the best time...)

&gt;<i> The not-so-good news is that using the same type backed by different
</I>&gt;<i> accesses will make the calls into the ByteAccess (or whatever the type
</I>&gt;<i> is) polymorphic, spoiling it for the JIT (at least if both are used from
</I>&gt;<i> the same call-site).
</I>
Yes, this is something we will need to address sooner or later. As I
demonstrated at our hackathon in Madison, I have a couple of good ideas.
It just needs a proper home for them, and I think scijava-ops is actually
the best place.

&gt;<i> I think, we should go for the sun.misc.Unsafe for now.
</I>
Fair enough.

&gt;<i> If it really turns out to be a show-stopper, we will have to look into
</I>&gt;<i> using primitive arrays and pinning. One downside of that would be that
</I>&gt;<i> then the memory must be owned by Java, so it would be a problem for the
</I>&gt;<i> Avian integration.
</I>
No, not at all. Avian has very good memory management.

But Avian also supports Unsafe, even if other JVMs might not (Unsafe is
not a part of the official Java API, after all, with Oracle's JVM you
still have to play dirty tricks to access Unsafe).

In contrast to Oracle's JVM, Avian makes accessing Unsafe very easy and
not only that: Avian's JIT will completely inline the memory accesses via
Unsafe:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/ReadyTalk/avian/blob/master/src/compile.cpp#L3965">https://github.com/ReadyTalk/avian/blob/master/src/compile.cpp#L3965</A>

In effect, Avian's access via Unsafe is -- apart from the one-time cost of
JITting the code at the start of the program -- *as* performant as native
C accesses would be.

&gt;<i> Another downside is that JNI implementations are not forced to pin the
</I>&gt;<i> array, they may just decide to copy the data.
</I>
That's not quite correct: the larger the data structure you are accessing,
the more less possible it is that the JNI implementation can move the data
around. This is not dictated by the standard, but by simple considerations
of practicability.

&gt;<i> I also made a imglib2-vigra branch that uses Unsafe
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/tpietzsch/vigra-imglib2/commits/unsafe">https://github.com/tpietzsch/vigra-imglib2/commits/unsafe</A> (requires the
</I>&gt;<i> buffer-and-unsafe branch of imglib2).
</I>
Great!

In related news, I managed to get literally all the important changes into
Avian that are required to run SCIFIO (in the process being the top #4
committer of Avian).

Also in related news, the nar-maven-plugin is already at version
3.0.0-rc-2, available via Maven Central (Tobi, rc-2 already has the
changes you wanted for javah, no need to depentd on a SNAPSHOT release
that was never deployed). Just for the record, I am top #3 committer of
the nar-maven-plugin project and now co-maintainer with Curtis Rueden,
all driven by the vigra-imglib2 project.

My next steps will be a little slower because real work caught up with me.
But my plan is to provide an easy way to compile the native part of
vigra-imglib2. Part of the solution will be to have Avian and VIGRA as
submodules (I know, Git submodules could have been designed much better,
but for the task at hand, they come in handy). To address the rest of the
problem Ulli faced, I will modify the Maven project so that the output
will be a C++ library that has Avian and SCIFIO/ImgLib2 compiled-in,
without the need to compile other stuff manually or install too many other
components (although C++ compiler and CMake will always have to be
installed by the user, unfortunately).

Ciao,
Johannes
