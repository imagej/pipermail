<PRE>Hi all,

what about having a Java 7 Fork/Join inspired ThreadService as an
independent component forming a dependency of SJC?  As SJC grows,
cutting it into pieces that can optionally be grouped by parent-poms is
probably due sooner or later anyways.  May be this is the day of birth
for SJCC (SJC-concurrency).

Tobias, thanks for bringing up the deadlock issue!

Best,
Stephan

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After sleeping on it, I do not think SJC ThreadService is actually the way
</I>&gt;<i> to go for providing better threading configuration of algorithms. But
</I>&gt;<i> unlike Tobias, I do *not* think this is because SJC contexts are
</I>&gt;<i> burdensome. Specifically, in response to Tobias's comment:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [SJC] is absolutely not the right thing if you are building a library in
</I>&gt;<i> my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly disagree; SJC was created to benefit SCIFIO, and it has done so
</I>&gt;<i> tremendously. I can elaborate on this if you like, but suffice to say that
</I>&gt;<i> even libraries have configuration and state and services that they need to
</I>&gt;<i> provide, and a unified context is an excellent way to do this. If you
</I>&gt;<i> instead rely on statics, you will create something that cannot be extended.
</I>&gt;<i> We learned this from painful experience with Bio-Formats!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, the reason I think SJC ThreadService is wrong for this use case is
</I>&gt;<i> due to another bullet point I mentioned earlier:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Easy to override threading behavior on a case-by-case basis
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (i.e., pass different ExecutorServices to different algorithms).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is, SJC services are singletons, intended to store state for the
</I>&gt;<i> application context. The threading configuration for running an algorithm
</I>&gt;<i> might be different than that for another algorithm running in the same
</I>&gt;<i> context. We need to be able to configure it individually. While
</I>&gt;<i> ThreadService might be able to serve as a sensible default configuration
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., &quot;just use SJC's ExecutorService by default&quot;), it should not be
</I>&gt;<i> forced on every algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I pointed out, this has been done exactly right in Java 7 Fork/Join
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; framework (by people who presumably put more thought and experience
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into it than we could). If the majority insists that we reimplement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something similar, then at least let us use the same interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that it would be great if we could use something that has been
</I>&gt;<i> vetted by the greater Java community. However, this makes porting to
</I>&gt;<i> non-JavaSE-7 platforms much more difficult. Tobias, I know you pointed out
</I>&gt;<i> some java.util.concurrent leakages into ThreadService -- we weren't being
</I>&gt;<i> overly careful about it yet -- but my point stands that SJC has the
</I>&gt;<i> potential to make those sorts of ports easier if we put effort into it.
</I>&gt;<i> More Jenkins builds against alternative Java implementations would be a
</I>&gt;<i> great start toward that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, it's not that I *want* to reimplement something similar to Java 7's
</I>&gt;<i> Fork/Join... it's that I don't have a good alternative if we also want to
</I>&gt;<i> support those other scenarios. One possible compromise would be design our
</I>&gt;<i> own agnostic interface, and provide an implementation in its own module
</I>&gt;<i> which uses Java 7's Fork/Join. That way, it will be possible to provide an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative implementation on platforms which don't support it. This sort
</I>&gt;<i> of interface-driven extensible design is *exactly* what SJC seeks to make
</I>&gt;<i> possible with its plugin framework.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Curtis
