Message-ID: <4D99E449.2090500@doube.net>

Hi all,

I have tried several times and failed to import the ImageJ2 source as an
Eclipse project using the instructions here:
http://imagejdev.org/eclipse

I'm using Ubuntu 10.10, Eclipse Galileo (from apt repo, though Helios
binary from eclipse.org is also affected) and Sun's JDK.

When I try to "Check out ImageJ", in step 3 the drop down list is greyed
out where I should be selecting 'svn', and the Finish button is also
greyed out.

JavaHL is not installed by installing subversion, it is provided by
libsvn-java.  However, installing libsvn-java doesn't fix the problem,

I'm now stuck because apparently JavaHL is installed
(Window-Preferences-Team-SVN shows me a version number).

Any ideas?  I'd like to start playing with the new code with a view to
moving BoneJ to it.

Michael

Hi Michael,

I'm not sure what the issue could be. But as a quick workaround you could
check out the source via the command line (svn co
http://dev.imagejdev.org/svn/imagej/trunk imagej) and then import existing
maven projects to get it into eclipse.

Thanks for the info, and sorry for the misinformation. I have updated the
instructions accordingly.

The "m2eclipse Extras" provide the Maven/SCM integration. Since I wrote
those instructions, they have updated the Extras to be more granular. You
must now also install the "Maven Integration for Subclipse" in order to
import Maven projects via SVN. I tested it just now, and it works for me. I
have updated the instructions accordingly.

Alternately, if you don't want to use m2eclipse Extras, you can do what
Barry suggested: check out the code using SVN on the command line, then
"File > Import > Existing Maven Projects" into Eclipse. (This is what we do
personally.)

Thanks Barry,

Don't know why this didn't occur to me: just new to Maven I guess.

Hmmm, looking at the diffs... it seems that tile position is stuffed into the time dimension.

So whats gonna happen if there is a time series tile scan?
"There may be trouble ahead, but while there's moonlight, and music, and love and romance..."

Do we have a strategy in imageJ2 for dealing with multi stage xy position data sets
that also allows time series?

Imglib is the answer guess? But hoiw?
Does imglib have a concept for this rather strange pair of extra dimensions: x and y stage position? 
Some kind of x and y offset (in theory also z could be "tiled" eg. when a z piezo stepper has a limited range, and you do several scans in z to cover a larger range)

???

Hi Dan-

<large scale tooting of own horn>

In fact, this type of data collection is not strange at all-- we, and  
many others do it alot.  It's really very helpful for gathering many  
examples in timelapse, and also for tiling.  Another example is the  
concept of a WellSample in HCS-- multiple images in different  
locations of the same Well.

In OME this is handled explicitly (http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2010-06/ome.xsd 
).  Look under the Plane Element for details.

I understand this approach is somewhat at odds with imglib. As we move  
forward towards a similar concept (http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/ticket/3678 
), we'll definitely keep an eye on what the Fiji/Imagejdev team is  
doing there.

Obviously, implementing this in software is technically not  
challenging, but it's not always clear how user wants data displayed.   
View 10 20 GB images at once?  Toggle them?  Montage? Tile?

</large scale tooting of own horn>

Cheers,

jason

(0, 0 ... 0), right?  ImageJ has that already (at least in (x,y)), so it
would just have to be implemented in an N-D way for imglib.

Hi,

in imglib2, we introduced the interfaces Interval and RealInterval for
that.  They do not only have a size but also an offset.

Furthermore, imglib2 supports what we call views (after the respective
term in the GIL).  Views transparently map data from one coordinate
frame into another (transpose, flip, reduce, extend, ... just to name a
few integer coordinate transfers; rotate, scale, affine, polynomial,
splines, ... real coordinate transfer).

You can make a View that would generate data out of multiple image data
sets, each of them transformed.  The importer must still be special
purpose for the targeted file format.

Check out our discussion page at

http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/wiki/index.php/ImgLib2_Discussion

and a class diagram for better understanding of the interfaces (views
not included, they just implement RandomAccessible or
RealRandomAccessible respectively):

http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=imglib.git;a=blob_plain;f=imglib/doc/imglib2.svg;hb=imglib2-dirty

Best,
Stephan

Exactly... 
I just wonder how we are going to get imglib and these higher dimensions to play nice?

I guess the way familiar to most imageJ users will be to have a single "hyperstack"  window, which only ever shows one image at a time (or maybe 2 images in magenta / green, or 3 images as  RGB or CYM) with a slider for every dimension other than x and y. 

I suppose there is no need to say that x and y must be the 2 dimensions plotted to the screen.... once could choose which 2 to plot, 
and relegate the others to having sliders. 

In the 3D viewer.... same story, choose which 3 dimensions to render as a volume, and have sliders for the others?

As you suggest, once can also imagine a "'google maps" type viewer for large tiled image data sets, where you can see and over view of the whole structure when zoomed out, and also zoom in to see the details of one area... and of course Stephan Saalfeld already did exactly that right here:
http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/
so we have a good idea how to approach that i guess?
I think I remember that this required pre computation of the over view, zoomed out images at various scales.. and this is exactly why imaris takes forever to open large images... its calculating the down sampled representations.... so once its loaded the zooming in and out is fast...

LSM files can be 1D line scans over multiple data channels (lambda or spectral scan) over time. 
We have no way of easily displaying that in imageJ right now without jumping through many hoops...
but we should aim to make a good general and trivial (for the user)  solution for the 2D and 3D display of n dimensional pixels?

Whats the plan in imageJ2 for this Curtis?
Now the 1st alpha is out... its certainly the right time to get this stuff nailed down right?
Is there a design for the new "hyperstack" pixel data viewer?

I imagine a display configuration window gadget... something like the image disply properties in imaris, where you can choose which dimension to show as x and whoch as y on the 2D display, and which extra dimensions with sliders, and which as different colour channels (like composite, still with a slider?). LUTs could also be handled in there....?

This is all tied into the ongoing discussion about and OME/imglib work on n-dimensional ROIs I guess...

Right now there is the imglib1/2 stuff to sort out, so better not get too distracted from that...
but anyway, these are ideas for the future. 

cheers

Dan

Hi all,

Yes the positions are stuffed into the time dimension for now. I decided to
do that to keep a single image window per lsm file. However, once opened,
the image info carries the exact count of each dimension, so it's always
possible to split e.g. positions into multiple image windows.
Here's how to retrieve the number of positions and time points:

   List.setList(getMetadata('info'));

print (List.getValue('P_size'));

print (List.getValue('T_size'));

The other option would have been open each position in separate image
windows, but this would output unpredictable number of windows, possibly
breaking some workflows.

Jerome.

Message-ID: <BANLkTimEh48QtVD21qP-6+LrmE-42_=KCg@mail.gmail.com>

Some folks from Perkin Elmer just visited us and one of them mentioned a
piece of software called Icy (http://www.bioimageanalysis.org). I was
wondering if anyone has heard of it and if so, if they could tell me how
this is different at all from ImageJ.

Interesting tidbits:

   - Icy uses BioFormats, though it isn't listed on the BioFormats
   applications page.
   - It can read some ImageJ plugins.
   - Evidently it was published last month (

Hi,

There was a bit of discussion on the ImageJDev Skype chat on 2/22/11 at 
4:00PM CST.  At that time they were having beta testing by invitation.  
Curtis sent an e-mail to a couple of the project leaders about three 
weeks ago to break the ice (sorry :) and explore potential 
collaboration, but AFAIK hasn't heard back.

They don't seem to be open source yet:

Sounds very nice, and is certainly of interest to the imageJ community...
as we are moving towards systems biology approaches where
massively parallel computing is a requirement. 

Around here we have a small cluster 100 nodes or so runbning sun grid engine,
and also access to the larger cluster in Dresden's TUD. 

We don't have experience with the Amazon cloud systems ... yet...

ImageJ2 will have a better design for running in a headless (no GUI) manner, 
which should help a great deal with this kind of stuff. 
Many imageJ plugins are tied to a GUI, and cant be run headless...
in the future that will no longer be a limitation for a properly written plugin. 

see
http://imagejdev.org/

maybe you might like to get involved?

Yes, very great interest.

High content screening, many thousands to millions of images
to be processed in pipelines, or even with decisions made on the fly, 
classification of phenotypes from images.... 

Cell profiler is currently better geared to this job than imageJ, 
but they play nice together. 

> We would love

the ImageJ-dev and Fiji teams are where this stuff is happening...
there are mailing lists and IRC channels where you can chat to 
those who know more about it than me....

and this is our invitation to communicate directly with the interested developers 
of imageJ2 and Fiji
 (

Funny you should ask - it's on my agenda to mention it at group  
meeting on Thursday.  It was announced at ISBI.  It seems like it's  
trying to be ImageJ with 5D support and nice organization for plugins,  
so in many ways it's redundant with the ImageJdev effort.  Will  
elaborate more on Thursday but am curious to hear others' take on it.

We certainly run into this problem in our project.  We can't pop up a
window when we are running on many machines concurrently in the Cloud.
 We ended up using the ImageProcessor type and performed some
operations such as shifting and histogram on the images.  We look
forward to learning more about this domain as we get involved in the
project.

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] recording commands
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=6srQV98UBXubu413B_0ETC+RXog@mail.gmail.com>

Is ImageJ 2.0 implementing a recording system similar to the Macro
recording in ImageJ 1.x?

Will this recording system be generic, i.e. able to emit the commands
and their arguments, so that then a translator can emit a recording in
any language (java, jython, etc.)?

I recall that is the case, but just checking!

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] ImgLib2 merge to master
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=kb6U9OuMxYb6UVJ3XdNPU6kLvNA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Over the past couple of days, the ImgLib developers have consolidated the
various branches of ImgLib2, and everything is now merged to master.

Because many people are still using ImgLib1, we decided to change the
ImgLib2 package prefix to net.imglib2, and leave the ImgLib1 code intact and
in place (with package prefix mpicbg.imglib). Thus, the master branch now
has two subtrees: imglib1 and imglib2. Because they have different package
prefixes and different Maven identifiers, it is now possible to import the
whole enchilada into your IDE of choice, or compile the entire thing from
the command line using Maven, without any conflicts or overlap. (You could
even write a program that used both ImgLib1 and ImgLib2 if you wish, though
we don't recommend it.)

We also simplified the project directory names. It now looks like this:

imglib.git
  -> imglib1
    --> algorithms
    --> core
    --> io
    etc.
  -> imglib2
    --> algorithms
    --> core
    --> io
    etc.

Because we are still finishing the migration to ImgLib2, only a subset of
the ImgLib2 projects currently compile. However, the top-level ImgLib2 Maven
POM includes only those projects that compile (imglib, imglib-io and
imglib-ui), with the others (e.g., imglib-algorithms) commented out until
they have been migrated. Hence, you should be able to compile the top-level
Maven project with no errors. The downside is that if you wish to import
non-compiling project into an IDE, you will need to explicitly select the
relevant project folder.

If all goes well, the ImageJDev Hudson (http://dev.imagejdev.org:8080/) will
build ImgLib-daily tonight as usual, and continue serving resources (e.g.,
Javadocs) with no interruption of service.

Remaining tasks include:
1) Update Fiji Fakefiles to reflect the new directory structure above.
2) Create POM for imglib2/examples subtree.
3) Fix PolygonRegionOfInterestTest's testRealRandomAccess and testSize
(currently commented out).
4) Unify test package prefixes (move the packageless ones, and those with
package prefix "tests").

The ImageJDev team has already begun migrating the ImageJ2 codebase from
ImgLib1 to ImgLib2, and hopes to complete that work by the end of the week.

Thanks to Stephan Saalfeld, Tobias Pietzsch and Lee Kamentsky for their help
with the merge! Please let us know if you have any questions or problems
with it.

Regards,
Curtis

I just pushed a fix to Fiji's 'imglib-split' branch. imglib2-algorithms, 
imglib2-ij (and as a consequence, imglib2-scripting) and imglib2-ops do 
not compile yet.

This is a repeated, desperate plea to finally add a migration guide to the 
Wiki. We discussed this in Madison and agreed that such a migration guide 
is necessary, but nothing happened yet.

To clarify: I did not yet merge to Fiji's 'master' branch because I am 
unsure what you guys intend to do about the compile errors. If they are 
there to stay for a while anyway, I'd just as well merge now.

If I (or for that matter, others) would have been given the information, 
and thereby the chance, how to migrate code, the compilation would 
probably not be in such a desastrous stage only Eclipse users could 
possibly love.

Ciao,
Dscho

Hi,

thanks for putting your hands into this.  As Curtis has explained
already, the idea is to skip the non-compiling sub-projects from the
builds into a running system.  Thanks to Curtis and the ImageJDevs who
have circumvented a terrible bug in javac, these sub-projects are:

imglib2
--> core
--> io
--> ui

ImgLib1 as required for Fiji is entirely unaffected and compiles
bravely, just lives in another place.

That should be possible in the Fakefiles---not?!  Should I have a look?

In opposition to your workflow, we found it helpful to leave broken code
broken instead of break-fixing it into compiling but not functional
state until somebody runs into the trap (TODO comments are less hintful
than compile errors).  Eclipse allows us to do that and we are
thankfully using this opportunity.

Cheers,
Stephan

Eclipse shows an exclamation sign on the imglib project node and gives
up completely on indicating where there are errors.

Is there any way to make eclipse behave? I would like to fix
imglib2-scripting and I have no idea where to start. The first problem
is that some key imglib2 classes have disappeared, such as ImgCursor.
The documentation that Johannes was asking for would go a long way.

Hi Albert,

sometimes Eclipse gets stuck as you described. What always worked for me is
to recompile it for Java5, which really forces him to recompile everything
and afterwards go back to Java6 ... you find it in Project -> Properties ->
Java Compiler

Sometimes there are also simply some jar files missing, check the "problems"
tab for that ...

Bye bye,
Stephan

Hi Albert,

as Steffi pointed out, you are missing dependencies as is shown in the
Problems window.  You may not see detailed compile errors before the
project settings are reasonably in place.  In the left tab, you have
been diving into the file tree instead the source package tree which is
on top and closed.  Have you imported the project using Maven?

Best,
Stephan

imglib used to work without maven. So before writing code for imglib I
have to learn how to use eclipse and before that, how to use maven?
Great way to keep anyone from contributing.

I imported the project by creating a new java project and telling it
to use the imglib folder.

The source package tree at the top is not closed: it's empty. Git
didn't remove the empty folders, there may have been temp ".~" files
in them.

Perhaps I should import each imglib1 and imglib2 as separate projects.
Trying that. Yes, that restored sanity. Should have thought of that
earlier.

No---but it makes life easier.  You are free to import each project
independently and care about the editor, builder/dependencies yourself
like in any other project.  E.g. imglib2-core has no dependencies which
makes that extremely easy.

> I imported the project by creating a new java project and telling it

You have to use the src/main/java folder and, if you like the
src/test/java folder as well.  Eclipse lets you add/edit/remove source
folders later easily.

Need help on finding out what happened to this class. Is there a
replacement or a new way of doing the transfer, or should I roll my
own?

  net.imglib2.function.RealTypeConverter


Regarding your question, Johannes: most of what I needed to take care
in scripting for imglib2 is that:

1. ImgCursor disappeared and using Cursor works just fine.
2. Cursor is an interface and it lacks a "getImg", so I had to store
the Img deep in the most abstract classes, where before only the
Cursor was stored.

Hi Albert,

RealTypeConverter could be resurrected, just pick it from imglib1, if
you need it.  I do not like it because it does not care about type
boundaries and transfers short to int through a double.

The preferred design choice would be to store the IterableInterval<T>
instead a Cursor<T> and create as many Cursor<T> as you need on demand.
This is by no means more consumptive than keeping a Cursor<T> keeping a
handle on the IterableInterval<T>.

The QuickStart section of 
http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/How_To_Migrate_Code_From_ImgLib_To_ImgLib2 is 
unfortunately too much in-flux at the moment, changing from useful to 
useless and back within a short period.

I cannot really fix things, because other people rightfully kill my edits, 
as I lack the deep insight into ImgLib2 that would be necessary.

May I suggest to give the QuickStart a few weeks or months to settle down 
to something that gives you clean and simple recipes how to update your 
code?

Thanks,
Dscho

Regarding the issues with Eclipse and Maven, you do not need either of these
tools, but they both make things much easier and are well worth the
relatively minor time investment.

Stephan is correct that you do not need to use Maven at all. You could
import each subproject as its own Eclipse project manually. File > Import >
File System and then choose e.g. "imglib2/core" as the root folder. As
Stephan says, you will then need to set src/main/java and src/test/java as
source folders. Further, for projects with dependencies?e.g., imglib2-io
depends on imglib2 and bio-formats?you would need to manually link up those
dependencies, either as JAR files or Eclipse project dependencies.

I will emphasize that doing all of the above is a LOT more work than just
installing the m2eclipse plugin and using "import existing Maven projects."
If you do it the Maven way, it takes care of all the dependencies
automatically. You can have any combination of projects open in Eclipse and
they will work just fine.

There isn't really much to "learn" about Maven. If your project gets messed
up somehow, you can reset it by right-clicking and choosing "Maven > Update
Project Configuration" and then Project > Clean > Clean all projects. Those
two steps will almost always fix puzzling issues.

The same goes for NetBeans and IDEA, which both also feature Maven support
out of the box. We have directions on the ImageJDev web site (
http://imagejdev.org/ides) for setting up Eclipse, NetBeans, IDEA, or the
command line. They are tailored for ImageJ2 but the same concepts apply to
ImgLib.

If you don't want to use an IDE, you can develop the code using Maven on the
command line. If you don't want to use Maven either, you can do that too.
Simply run the "mvn dependency:copy-dependencies" target one time, and you
will notice a new folder "target/dependencies" containing all the dependent
JARs. You can then set your CLASSPATH to point to all of those, as well as
src/main/java, and hack away as usual in vim or Emacs or whatever. Of
course, these JAR files will not be automatically updated as those projects
evolve, and for inter-project dependencies within imglib (e.g., imglib-io
depending on imglib) you may want your CLASSPATH pointing to multiple
src/main/java folders, but it is all doable.

Please ask if you have any further questions or issues relating to the build
system?I would be happy to help!

I tried the java 6 to 5 change, and then also looked into the problems
tab. Nothing looks conspicuous. I am attaching a screenshot. Notice
how the package list shows as hierarchical instead of flat for some
reason despite the setting to "Flat".

Please let me know if anything stands out as the obvious problem.

Because the create method of the factory creates the interpolator, not
another factory.

You mean

final RealRandomAccess<R> inter;

Or you mean

switch (mode) {
                case LINEAR:
                        inter = new NLinearInterpolatorFactory<R>();
                        break;
                case NEAREST_NEIGHBOR:
                        inter = new NearestNeighborInterpolatorFactory<R>();
                        break;
                default:
                        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Scale: don't know how to scale
with mode " + mode);
                }

I meant this one--silly me--but it doesn't work either:

"Type mismatch: cannot convert from NLinearInterpolatorFactory<R> to
InterpolatorFactory<R,Img<R>>"

Folks --
My class started as 'LUT' and I renamed it to 'Lut' but got the filename 
out of sync.  I fixed it but now there are two files: Lut.java and 
LUT.java.  I committed and fetched and pushed and... to no avail.  Can 
someone delete the LUT.java file or tell me how to?
Thanks,
Grant

Classical Windows & MacOSX problem, due to case-insensitive filenames :-)

Rename your file, delete the version you do _not_ want to keep from your 
version control system, rename the file back to the name you want to keep 
(but make sure that the cases are right!).

Ciao,
