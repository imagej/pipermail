<PRE>Hi Carn&#235;,

I am no longer working with the lab that worked with Antti. I have looked
at the backups I made when I left and I do not have a copy of Antti's work.
Some people in my old lab might have it and they check this mailing list.
However I have also CCed Gabriel Landini (affiliated with Fiji) as he
worked with me on this a bit and may have made a copy of the code.

&gt;<i> Hi Barry
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> early last year you have contacted Antti Niemist&#246; about his HistThresh

</I>&gt;<i> released under GPLv2+. In the mailing list, he agreed to release it
</I>&gt;<i> under BSD for ImageJ2 development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, it appears that he no longer works at the Tampere
</I>&gt;<i> University of Technology and the website for the project has been
</I>&gt;<i> taken down. His previous email address has also been cancelled and I
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't find his new contact. I tried to use wayback machine to
</I>&gt;<i> salvage his project, but the last backup [2] was before the last
</I>&gt;<i> release (he made one release prompted by your email which fixed a
</I>&gt;<i> couple of bugs in the minimum and maximum likelihood method). I have
</I>&gt;<i> made a github repository with the version I found [3]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I made an Octave port which works fine for me [4] but I know some
</I>&gt;<i> Matlab users who would like to use it. Would you happen to have made a
</I>&gt;<i> backup of the last release he made?
