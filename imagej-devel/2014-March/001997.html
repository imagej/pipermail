<PRE>Hi Curtis,

</I>
I would like to do that anyway.

&gt;<i> * imagej-ops core framework -&gt; scijava-ops
</I>&gt;<i>   -- the core framework is not image specific
</I>
How about doing that later? There is no need to stress ourselves out about
it; we can easily do that anytime.

&gt;<i> * ij-core module framework -&gt; migrate into scijava-ops
</I>&gt;<i>   -- that framework includes modules, commands, displays and widgets
</I>&gt;<i>   -- Christian asked me: why not move ij-core's module framework into
</I>&gt;<i> scijava-common?
</I>&gt;<i>   -- I strongly considered that, but instead I think it fits perfectly into
</I>&gt;<i> the OPS framework
</I>
I agree, but I would suggest doing that later, too.

&gt;<i> * imagej-ops image processing ops -&gt; stay in imagej-ops
</I>&gt;<i>   -- these ops are image-specific, and depend on ImgLib2
</I>
That makes absolute sense (as the above), but I would like to focus on
using ij-ops first. Traditionally, it has been much easier to develop a
fast-moving project when it is maintained in a single repository.

&gt;<i> * imagej-ops widgets -&gt; stay in imagej-ops
</I>&gt;<i>   -- and move Swing-specific code into ij-ui-swing
</I>
I guess that probably needs to happen sooner rather than later because the
technical debt incurred by mixing UI with processing can be a huge pain in
the back side.

&gt;<i> * ij-core scripting framework -&gt; scijava-scripting
</I>&gt;<i>   -- scripting support is not image-specific
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * ij-scripting-* -&gt; scijava-scripting-*
</I>&gt;<i>   -- each of these has different, often very large, dependencies
</I>
I agree that this is a good plan, but again, I would love to see this
happening later. Preferably after switching Fiji to the ImageJ2 script
editor because I see a couple of architectural questions looming for us;
These architectural issues are much easier solved when all involved code
lives in the same repository.

&gt;<i> * other ij-core unrelated stuff -&gt; think more; consider case-by-case
</I>&gt;<i>   -- maybe some goes to scijava-common...
</I>&gt;<i>   -- would be nice if the &quot;ij-core&quot; module could completely go away
</I>
Whoa. Radical food for thought. But I begin to see your reasoning and to
agree.

&gt;<i> I know that such changes would rock the boat... again. But before we get
</I>&gt;<i> too much farther along I would like to have a very clear, sensible policy
</I>&gt;<i> which answers the question: &quot;What is SciJava, and what is ImageJ?&quot; And I
</I>&gt;<i> think the structure above would do that, and be a really strong foundation
</I>&gt;<i> for the next decade at least.
</I>
Makes sense. How about revisiting the split in two weeks? We could even
call it milestone 0.2.0.

Ciao,
Dscho
