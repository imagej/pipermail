Hi Barry, Carn&#235;,
This is the only version I have of the maximum likelihood estimator 
(th_maxlik.m) code from Anti's website. The date of the file in my computer is 
2/Nov/2004.
His method uses the th_minimum.m procedure as a first approximation, which in 
turn uses the bimodtest.m and others (also attached), but in my endeavours of 
porting the th_maxlik method in Java for IJ I failed miserably in reproducing 
the results that the code gave for matlab (shown in the pdf attached).
I spent some time with this particular method trying to resolve what was the 
issue, but I never succeeded, so rather than having a broken method, I left it 
our from the autothreshold plugin.

I hope it is useful.

Regards

Gabriel

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HistThresh toolbox contains selected histogram-based thresholding
algorithms for MATLAB. The toolbox has been tested with MATLAB 6.5
(R13), but it may work with some older versions of MATLAB as well.


CURRENT VERSION
---------------

v1.02 (2 Nov 2004)
- minor update: fixed the perpetual loop bug in th_minimum.m and
  th_intermodes.m


INSTALLATION
------------

Extract the contents of the zip file &quot;HistThresh.zip&quot; into a directory
from which MATLAB can find the m-files.


GETTING STARTED
---------------

The thresholding algorithms are named with the prefix &quot;th_&quot;. For
example, &quot;th_minimum.m&quot; is the function for the algorithm by Prewitt
and Mendelsohn that chooses the threshold to be in the valley of a
bimodal histogram. The threshold for an 8-bit image can be found by
typing &quot;T = th_minimum(I)&quot;. Further help can be obtained by typing
&quot;help &lt;m-file&gt;&quot; in MATLAB, where &quot;&lt;m-file&gt;&quot; is replaced by the name of
an m-file.
