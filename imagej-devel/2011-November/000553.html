<PRE>Hi Lee,

In analogy to integer transforms &amp; views we should have AffineTransform, 
which maps (coordinate) vectors to vectors.

Then we would have a view class that implements RealRandomAccessible. 
This view class is what you referred to as CoordinateAffineTransform. 
It would take another RealRandomAccessible and an AffineTransform, as 
you described.

The AffineTransform in turn would tie into a transform hierarchy: 
Affine is probably the most general transform we would support.  So 
there will be an interface Affine which extends RealTransform. 
Interface Rigid would derive from Affine and so on.  This interface 
hierarchy specifies the transform hierarchy, e.g., a Rigid is also an 
Affine.  Then on the implementation side we have
public class AffineTransform implements Affine, Concatenable&lt; Affine &gt;, 
PreConcatenable&lt; Affine &gt; {...}.

Lets assume, we implement a restricted transform like scaling within the 
transform hierarchy.  Then the Scale (?) interface would derive from 
Affine and a ScaleTransform can be treated as an Affine.  This nicely 
separates the transforms from the implementation of the views, which 
will require implementing a RealRandomAccess that applies a transform to 
its position, etc. We can first do a general view implementation like 
your CoordinateAffineTransform.  You can naturally pass a Scale as the 
view transform.  This will be treated as a full Affine for the time 
being, doing a bit more work than necessary.  Later it is easy to write 
special cases for special transforms.  (For example, for the integer 
views there is a TranslationRandomAccess which is more efficient than 
the general MixedRandomAccess.)
