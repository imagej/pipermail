<PRE>Dear list,

a recent SPIM_Registration bug report on GitHub

<A HREF="https://github.com/bigdataviewer/SPIM_Registration/issues/10#issuecomment-79721014">https://github.com/bigdataviewer/SPIM_Registration/issues/10#issuecomment-79721014</A>

resulted in a discussion about the correct way of assigning version
numbers to individual artifacts.

We have earlier settled to follow SemVer

<A HREF="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</A>

which has reasonably clear guidelines under what circumstances to
increase which of three version counters.

&lt;quote src=&quot;<A HREF="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</A>&quot;&gt;
1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible
manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
&lt;/quote&gt;

It is unspecified, however, how version changes in dependency artifacts
affect the version of the consuming artifact, i.e. do they bubble or do
they not?  In my current understanding, there are two competing
objectives, deployment (advocated and executed by @dscho and @ctrueden),
and development (advocated and executed by @axtimwalde and @ctrueden, we
see that @ctrueden is ambivalent, @axtimwalde too, as always, just that
you know):

1.
Developer perspective: Don't bubble!  Developers that use the public API
of an artifact X in their code use SemVer to reason whether on upgrade
of X they will have to change their code or simply recompile with no
modification.  Dependency version bubbling would break this contract,
because it signalizes API incompatibility in X when a dependency Y of X
introduces incompatible changes, although this incompatibility does not
affect the public API of X.  Deployment of a set of artifacts following
this contract requires complete inspection of the entire set of
artifacts to guarantee consistency of the deployed version by other
means (maven pom tracing?) because the SemVer versions of individual
artifacts do not encode the necessary information.  I have the
impression that the developer perspective, ignoring it not being helpful
for deployment, was the driver of the SemVer specification and have a
preference for it because...

2.
Deployer perspective: Bubble?  Deployers could use SemVer to reason
whether a new version of an artifact has ANY incompatible changes
anywhere in its dependency tree.  This is useful to know when an
artifact in the tree can be released *without* considering its
dependents *and* dependencies (PATCH increase).  However, whenever the
version number signalizes incompatibility (MAJOR) or new features
(MINOR), further inspection of the entire dependency tree is required
because consistency cannot be derived from SemVer versions alone.  The
only definite conclusion that can be made from observing that an
artifact changes its MAJOR or MINOR version, i.e. becomes incompatible,
is that all dependents will need to be updated/ recompiled or that
there's a problem, consistency across artifacts cannot be guaranteed.
I.e. the bubbling scheme, at every individual artifact, sends a signal
when further inspection is required.  This information, however is
binary, and a single counter would suffice to do that.  If patch
counters are desired, one would need two.  The MAJOR and MINOR counters
are redundant.

Short:
Non-bubbling SemVer tells a developer whether her code will compile with
a given dependency artifact (PATCH and MINOR).  Bubbling SemVer tells a
deployer when a single artifact can be deployed without considering its
environment (PATCH).  Both things exclude each other.  In this setup, I
find the benefit for developers stronger and therefore prefer
non-bubbling SemVer.

An interesting animal are dependency management poms (BOMs) such as
pom-fiji or pom-mpicbg.  Their `public API' is the composite of  managed
dependencies and therefore it has to bubble the SemVer versions of the
managed dependencies.  This is different from artifacts that consume a
dependency, consuming and managing are different.  I may be wrong, but I
have the impression that these two things often get confused.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Stephan
