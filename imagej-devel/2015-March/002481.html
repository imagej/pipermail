<PRE>Hi Stephan,

Thanks for starting this thread!

For those interested, there was further discussion in IRC
&lt;<A HREF="http://code.imagej.net/chatlogs/imagejdev?times=prefix&amp;start-date=2015-03-16&amp;end-date=2015-03-16#20150316T155138">http://code.imagej.net/chatlogs/imagejdev?times=prefix&amp;start-date=2015-03-16&amp;end-date=2015-03-16#20150316T155138</A>&gt;
today, and Curtis and I chatted briefly face-to-face.

Basically, we agree that semver must be limited in scope to the public API
of a given project. Checking for dependency convergence must be handled
separately. Bubbling versions through dependencies is not significantly
meaningful.

Documentation on this (and other versioning issues) is on the wiki:
<A HREF="http://imagej.net/Architecture#Versioning">http://imagej.net/Architecture#Versioning</A>

&gt;<i>Artifact Y depends on artifact X and knew about the bug and had a
</I>workaround in place to compensate for it

As a side note, semver does not guarantee preservation of unintentional
behavior. As long as behavior is fixed in a way that's backwards-compatible
with public API, only patch versions need to change.

However, the idea is that a BOM will account for such a change, to avoid
dependency skew.

Best,
Mark

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Counter proof: Artifact X fixes a bug in one of its public methods, and
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly increases the PATCH counter.  Artifact Y depends on artifact
</I>&gt;<i> X and knew about the bug and had a workaround in place to compensate for
</I>&gt;<i> it.  On upgrade of dependency version for X, it removes the workaround,
</I>&gt;<i> public API remains unchanged.  This is a patch and X had increased the
</I>&gt;<i> PATCH counter, so Y increases the PATCH counter.  Neither X nor Y can be
</I>&gt;<i> deployed independently.  The deployment system (or person) has to
</I>&gt;<i> inspect the entire dependency tree to calculate a correct state or a
</I>&gt;<i> conflict.  The same is true in the non-bubbling situation.  Ergo,
</I>&gt;<i> bubbling versioning has no advantage over non-bubbling versioning in a
</I>&gt;<i> deployment context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This leads me to the conclusion that non-bubbling versioning is better
</I>&gt;<i> because it carries local information for developers that non-bubbling
</I>&gt;<i> versioning does not, i.e. in what way the API of the versioned artifact
</I>&gt;<i> was changed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I expect to be wrong still and that I missed something important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking forward to your responses.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resulted in a discussion about the correct way of assigning version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; numbers to individual artifacts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We have earlier settled to follow SemVer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which has reasonably clear guidelines under what circumstances to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; increase which of three version counters.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;quote src=&quot;<A HREF="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</A>&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manner, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;/quote&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is unspecified, however, how version changes in dependency artifacts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; affect the version of the consuming artifact, i.e. do they bubble or do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they not?  In my current understanding, there are two competing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; objectives, deployment (advocated and executed by @dscho and @ctrueden),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and development (advocated and executed by @axtimwalde and @ctrueden, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see that @ctrueden is ambivalent, @axtimwalde too, as always, just that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you know):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Developer perspective: Don't bubble!  Developers that use the public API
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of an artifact X in their code use SemVer to reason whether on upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of X they will have to change their code or simply recompile with no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modification.  Dependency version bubbling would break this contract,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because it signalizes API incompatibility in X when a dependency Y of X
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; introduces incompatible changes, although this incompatibility does not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; affect the public API of X.  Deployment of a set of artifacts following
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this contract requires complete inspection of the entire set of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; artifacts to guarantee consistency of the deployed version by other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means (maven pom tracing?) because the SemVer versions of individual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; artifacts do not encode the necessary information.  I have the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; impression that the developer perspective, ignoring it not being helpful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for deployment, was the driver of the SemVer specification and have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preference for it because...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Deployer perspective: Bubble?  Deployers could use SemVer to reason
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whether a new version of an artifact has ANY incompatible changes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anywhere in its dependency tree.  This is useful to know when an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; artifact in the tree can be released *without* considering its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dependents *and* dependencies (PATCH increase).  However, whenever the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version number signalizes incompatibility (MAJOR) or new features
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (MINOR), further inspection of the entire dependency tree is required
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because consistency cannot be derived from SemVer versions alone.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only definite conclusion that can be made from observing that an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; artifact changes its MAJOR or MINOR version, i.e. becomes incompatible,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is that all dependents will need to be updated/ recompiled or that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there's a problem, consistency across artifacts cannot be guaranteed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I.e. the bubbling scheme, at every individual artifact, sends a signal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when further inspection is required.  This information, however is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; binary, and a single counter would suffice to do that.  If patch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; counters are desired, one would need two.  The MAJOR and MINOR counters
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are redundant.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Short:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Non-bubbling SemVer tells a developer whether her code will compile with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a given dependency artifact (PATCH and MINOR).  Bubbling SemVer tells a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deployer when a single artifact can be deployed without considering its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environment (PATCH).  Both things exclude each other.  In this setup, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; find the benefit for developers stronger and therefore prefer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-bubbling SemVer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An interesting animal are dependency management poms (BOMs) such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pom-fiji or pom-mpicbg.  Their `public API' is the composite of  managed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dependencies and therefore it has to bubble the SemVer versions of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; managed dependencies.  This is different from artifacts that consume a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dependency, consuming and managing are different.  I may be wrong, but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have the impression that these two things often get confused.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please let me know your thoughts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Stephan
