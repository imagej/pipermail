<PRE>Dear ImageJ developers,

my earlier statement about the conclusion that can be drawn from
bubbling versions in a deployment context are wrong.

Counter proof: Artifact X fixes a bug in one of its public methods, and
accordingly increases the PATCH counter.  Artifact Y depends on artifact
X and knew about the bug and had a workaround in place to compensate for
it.  On upgrade of dependency version for X, it removes the workaround,
public API remains unchanged.  This is a patch and X had increased the
PATCH counter, so Y increases the PATCH counter.  Neither X nor Y can be
deployed independently.  The deployment system (or person) has to
inspect the entire dependency tree to calculate a correct state or a
conflict.  The same is true in the non-bubbling situation.  Ergo,
bubbling versioning has no advantage over non-bubbling versioning in a
deployment context.

This leads me to the conclusion that non-bubbling versioning is better
because it carries local information for developers that non-bubbling
versioning does not, i.e. in what way the API of the versioned artifact
was changed.

I expect to be wrong still and that I missed something important.

Looking forward to your responses.

Thanks,
Stephan

</I>&gt;<i> 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/quote&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is unspecified, however, how version changes in dependency artifacts
</I>&gt;<i> affect the version of the consuming artifact, i.e. do they bubble or do
</I>&gt;<i> they not?  In my current understanding, there are two competing
</I>&gt;<i> objectives, deployment (advocated and executed by @dscho and @ctrueden),
</I>&gt;<i> and development (advocated and executed by @axtimwalde and @ctrueden, we
</I>&gt;<i> see that @ctrueden is ambivalent, @axtimwalde too, as always, just that
</I>&gt;<i> you know):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.
</I>&gt;<i> Developer perspective: Don't bubble!  Developers that use the public API
</I>&gt;<i> of an artifact X in their code use SemVer to reason whether on upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> of X they will have to change their code or simply recompile with no
</I>&gt;<i> modification.  Dependency version bubbling would break this contract,
</I>&gt;<i> because it signalizes API incompatibility in X when a dependency Y of X
</I>&gt;<i> introduces incompatible changes, although this incompatibility does not
</I>&gt;<i> affect the public API of X.  Deployment of a set of artifacts following
</I>&gt;<i> this contract requires complete inspection of the entire set of
</I>&gt;<i> artifacts to guarantee consistency of the deployed version by other
</I>&gt;<i> means (maven pom tracing?) because the SemVer versions of individual
</I>&gt;<i> artifacts do not encode the necessary information.  I have the
</I>&gt;<i> impression that the developer perspective, ignoring it not being helpful
</I>&gt;<i> for deployment, was the driver of the SemVer specification and have a
</I>&gt;<i> preference for it because...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.
</I>&gt;<i> Deployer perspective: Bubble?  Deployers could use SemVer to reason
</I>&gt;<i> whether a new version of an artifact has ANY incompatible changes
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere in its dependency tree.  This is useful to know when an
</I>&gt;<i> artifact in the tree can be released *without* considering its
</I>&gt;<i> dependents *and* dependencies (PATCH increase).  However, whenever the
</I>&gt;<i> version number signalizes incompatibility (MAJOR) or new features
</I>&gt;<i> (MINOR), further inspection of the entire dependency tree is required
</I>&gt;<i> because consistency cannot be derived from SemVer versions alone.  The
</I>&gt;<i> only definite conclusion that can be made from observing that an
</I>&gt;<i> artifact changes its MAJOR or MINOR version, i.e. becomes incompatible,
</I>&gt;<i> is that all dependents will need to be updated/ recompiled or that
</I>&gt;<i> there's a problem, consistency across artifacts cannot be guaranteed.
</I>&gt;<i> I.e. the bubbling scheme, at every individual artifact, sends a signal
</I>&gt;<i> when further inspection is required.  This information, however is
</I>&gt;<i> binary, and a single counter would suffice to do that.  If patch
</I>&gt;<i> counters are desired, one would need two.  The MAJOR and MINOR counters
</I>&gt;<i> are redundant.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Short:
</I>&gt;<i> Non-bubbling SemVer tells a developer whether her code will compile with
</I>&gt;<i> a given dependency artifact (PATCH and MINOR).  Bubbling SemVer tells a
</I>&gt;<i> deployer when a single artifact can be deployed without considering its
</I>&gt;<i> environment (PATCH).  Both things exclude each other.  In this setup, I
</I>&gt;<i> find the benefit for developers stronger and therefore prefer
</I>&gt;<i> non-bubbling SemVer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An interesting animal are dependency management poms (BOMs) such as
</I>&gt;<i> pom-fiji or pom-mpicbg.  Their `public API' is the composite of  managed
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies and therefore it has to bubble the SemVer versions of the
</I>&gt;<i> managed dependencies.  This is different from artifacts that consume a
</I>&gt;<i> dependency, consuming and managing are different.  I may be wrong, but I
</I>&gt;<i> have the impression that these two things often get confused.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know your thoughts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Stephan
