Do you expect a JVM to be running already? If not, you should [create 
one](<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imagej-launcher/blob/3e061521a/src/main/c/ImageJ.c#L307-L322">https://github.com/imagej/imagej-launcher/blob/3e061521a/src/main/c/ImageJ.c#L307-L322</A>).

</I>
Heh, I have to admit that I did not remember at all why I did that. 
Happily, even I learned to write kick-ass commit messages, and I also 
learned the awesomeness of the `Blame` button on GitHub: 
<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imagej-launcher/blame/master/src/main/c/ImageJ.c#L264">https://github.com/imagej/imagej-launcher/blame/master/src/main/c/ImageJ.c#L264</A> 
(I vaguely remember writing that commit message after spending something 
between twenty and thirty super-focused hours on hunting down this bug, 
that was not really fun, that one hunt).

&gt;<i> I do the same, but (so far) with Python's ctypes.CDLL. That doesn't let 
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> specify RTLD_LAZY as a dlopen mode. So, I think that's the big 
</I>&gt;<i> difference
</I>&gt;<i> between how you do things and how I do them. My first question is 
</I>&gt;<i> whether
</I>&gt;<i> RTLD_LAZY is needed as the mode. My second question is why you needed 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> load libjli.dylib in the first place and, if you might grant me a third
</I>&gt;<i> wish, my third question is whether you've seen this error before.
</I>
The JLI library is only needed for forward compatibility, so that MacOSX 
does not annoy the user by a &quot;Do you want to install Java 6?&quot; popup.

And yes, I have seen an error like that before, but only when trying to 
attach to a running JVM from within Matlab (Matlab's very own GUI is 
written in Java... so there is already a JVM running in a Matlab 
instance although it is a bit tricky to get at it under certain 
circumstances, but it is impossible to run two Oracle JVMs in the same 
process in any case).

&gt;<i> Thanks in advance, Mr. Wizard.
</I>
Sorry, oh ye mighty Python God, I fear my input was not really helpful 
to your cause. But maybe you have a project for me to clone, with 
instructions that might let this poor Python pilgrim reproduce the 
issue?

Ciao,
Dscho
