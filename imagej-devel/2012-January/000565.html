<PRE>Hi Lee,

 I'm running into a number of problems with overlays that are caused by the
&gt;<i> fact that the EuclideanSpace is now defined on the Dataset and not on the
</I>&gt;<i> Display used to composite datasets and overlays. There are more than a few
</I>&gt;<i> issues:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Over the past few weeks, and during the Dresden hackathon, I finally found
time to pursue a lot of these issues, and have made changes to the codebase
to improve the data/display hierarchy.

   - The ImageDisplay interface now implements CalibratedInterval, which
   extends not only EuclideanSpace but also Interval. Further, unlike Data
   objects, ImageDisplay now also implements PositionableByAxis (which extends
   Localizable and Positionable). So an ImageDisplay always has a current
   position in the N-dimensional structure, and can report what that is.
   - Data objects (Datasets and Overlays) now implement CalibratedInterval,
   but not PositionableByAxis, since it makes no sense to ask a Data object
   what its current position is.
   - However, the DataView object, which wraps a Data and provides
   visualization-specific metadata about how that Data is currently being
   visualized, *does* implement PositionableByAxis.
   - An ImageDisplay is still a collection of DataViews as before, but uses
   the CombinedInterval class to combine the N-dimensional spaces of its
   constituent views into a single aggregate space.

Hopefully these changes are along the lines of what we discussed when I
visited Broad all those months ago.


&gt;<i>    - Trac issue ImageJ 558 - the user takes a Z-stack, multichannel image
</I>&gt;<i>    and thresholds it to get a BinaryMaskOverlay and associated ROI. The ROI is
</I>&gt;<i>    properly defined in a 4-dimensional space. However, when displayed, a
</I>&gt;<i>    single X/Y plane should be sampled and displayed, but there is no mechanism
</I>&gt;<i>    to retrieve the plane being displayed or the color display mode. The code
</I>&gt;<i>    iterates through the entire stack and that's what causes it to update
</I>&gt;<i>    slowly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I haven't had time to examine this issue in much detail, but the fix you
implemented long ago seems fine for the time being.


&gt;<i>    - Datasets have axes which capture the metadata of what a particular
</I>&gt;<i>    dimension means. Overlays don't have that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>As mentioned above, things have now been unified so that all Data objects
(including both Datasets and Overlays) are N-dimensional with axes, by
extending the CalibratedInterval interface, which in turn extends Interval
and CalibratedSpace (which extends EuclideanSpace).


&gt;<i>    - Channels are really categorical, not ordinal - there's no reason the
</I>&gt;<i>    red channel is zero, the green is one and the blue is two and, with a
</I>&gt;<i>    channel-stack, the DAPI channel in one image might be the PI channel in a
</I>&gt;<i>    second. You can properly relate one channel to the other through metadata,
</I>&gt;<i>    but overlays don't have that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think channels are sometimes categorical, and sometimes ordinal. For
example, a hyperspectral dataset that provides 32 channels ranging from 400
nm through 550 nm sampled every 5 nm would be a continuous domain, similar
to other dimensions. But if you have two channels&#8212;one transmitted channel
captured using a grayscale camera, and another channel detected from
fluorescence caused by laser scanning&#8212;those are definitely categorical.

Still, ultimately, they become ordinal in that you must provide an index
for each channel. That doesn't mean you should assume continuity though, of
course.


&gt;<i>    - You might want to composite datasets - take two images and place
</I>&gt;<i>    them adjacently. What happens if they have different axes? What happens if
</I>&gt;<i>    they have different channel layouts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>In general, some math needs to happen. The new
CombinedInterval&lt;<A HREF="http://fiji.sc/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=imagej2/.git;a=blob;f=core/data/src/main/java/imagej/data/CombinedInterval.java;h=24aec4a1305a28aaead11709733ef96e677a1672;hb=refs/heads/svn/trunk">http://fiji.sc/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=imagej2/.git;a=blob;f=core/data/src/main/java/imagej/data/CombinedInterval.java;h=24aec4a1305a28aaead11709733ef96e677a1672;hb=refs/heads/svn/trunk</A>&gt;class
handles the union of multiple CalibratedInterval objects, fairly
naively at the moment, but with the potential to improve the logic as you
suggest in the future. We are also planning to tap into Unidata's Ucar
Units&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/ctrueden/ucar-units">https://github.com/ctrueden/ucar-units</A>&gt;project to assist with
this.

 So, what I'm thinking is the following:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - A display represents the EuclideanSpace that's used to composite
</I>&gt;<i>    overlays and datasets.  Think of the display as a big N-dimensional
</I>&gt;<i>    container and the overlays and datasets float inside that container.
</I>&gt;<i>    - The display has a set of axes that are the union of all of the axes
</I>&gt;<i>       that appear in the view data objects.
</I>&gt;<i>       - There are two behaviors for a view object that does not have an
</I>&gt;<i>       axis in the space. Perhaps the user selects the behavior?:
</I>&gt;<i>          - The value in space outside of a single plane defined by a
</I>&gt;<i>          coordinate location along the axis is nan or null.
</I>&gt;<i>          - The value in space along the missing axis is the same at all
</I>&gt;<i>          locations along that axis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, this is as we discussed at Broad a few months back. It is really
working now! :-)

Currently, if a constituent DataView lacks an axis from the aggregate
space, the value for that axis can be specified explicitly, and defaults to
0 otherwise. So, for example, all Overlays currently have the X and Y axes,
and no other axes. Embedding a rectangle overlay in a 4D dataset (with,
say, XYZT) causes that rectangle to be visible at Z=0, T=0, and no other Z
and T positions, unless the DataView.setPosition(long, AxisType) method is
used to override a different position for that dimension.

In the future, we could enable the user to specify an alternative behavior
as you suggest, such that the overlay becomes visible at *all* positions of
that axis. But for now it is always a constant value.


&gt;<i>    - A display window holds the information about what plane is being
</I>&gt;<i>    displayed and how the channels are composited.
</I>&gt;<i>       - The views are asked to display according to the plane
</I>&gt;<i>       information. A plane is an interval where the min=max for all dimensions
</I>&gt;<i>       but X and Y. The views could construct appropriate projectors based on the
</I>&gt;<i>       interval. The display window should also control the channel compositing
</I>&gt;<i>       information and the views should reference the display window's compositing
</I>&gt;<i>       information instead of maintaining their own copies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Right, as things stand now, the ImageDisplay tracks its current position
(i.e., it implements PositionableByAxis) and the DisplayPanel provides the
GUI that actually presents the information onscreen. However, one vital
remaining task is to finish decoupling these two classes. Currently there
is still some unfortunate coupling between ImageDisplay, ImageCanvas,
DisplayPanel and DisplayWindow, which needs to change. The ImageDisplay and
DataViews should be completely UI-agnostic, with the active user interface
components subscribing to display events and updating themselves
accordingly. This will help eliminate some problematic sections of code,
particularly SwingDatasetView and SwingOverlayView, which are discouraged
to use in ImageJ plugins due to their Swing-specific nature.


&gt;<i>    - Perhaps there is a SpatialDataObject or perhaps the DataObject is
</I>&gt;<i>    always spatial. In any case, the axis information and channel metadata
</I>&gt;<i>    should be pushed up the inheritance hierarchy so that Overlay has a
</I>&gt;<i>    first-class representation of that and operations that generate overlays
</I>&gt;<i>    from datasets copy the information to the overlays they create.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>We went the route of &quot;data objects are always spatial.&quot; And yeah, a lot of
functionality was pushed up into AbstractData, AbstractDataView and
AbstractImageDisplay. Hopefully this will reduce the amount of dataset- and
overlay-specific code throughout the system.


&gt;<i>    - There is a spectral dimension, but the channel axis doesn't capture
</I>&gt;<i>    that. Channels are categorical and should have names so they can be matched
</I>&gt;<i>    in the same way that axes are matched.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It is a good point that we should add some support for categorical
dimensions in general. It is not enough to have calibrations; it should be
possible to label each axis position individually. This is useful for a
variety of reasons. We will need to revisit this idea later, when time
permits.

 It's some work to refactor these things, but as the code base grows and
&gt;<i> becomes more entrenched it will become increasingly difficult to refactor,
</I>&gt;<i> so we should do it sooner rather than later. I don't think this is much
</I>&gt;<i> coding at this point and if you look at the code, there are places where
</I>&gt;<i> this organization clarifies some things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The coding work has been nontrivial, but certainly doable. There is more
left to do as well, but I think we are in reasonable shape.

Thanks very much for your comments! I really appreciate how much thought
and effort you have put into the ImageJ design over the past year.

Regards,
Curtis
