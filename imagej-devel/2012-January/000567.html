<PRE>Hi Adrian,

I agree with Johan. Micro-Manager went to a lot of effort to create a
unified interface for acquisition, so best would be to use it. The ImageJ2
and Micro-Manager teams are working together in areas of overlap, and I
expect will do so more as both projects mature. The Micro-Manager
developers gave a lot of initial feedback and suggestions regarding
difficulties they encountered with ImageJ1, which has really helped guide
the development of ImageJ2. So the plan is for Micro-Manager to take
advantage of IJ2's flexible architecture, once things are far enough along.

In short, I don't see Micro-Manager going away any time soon, so it makes a
lot of sense to base your acquisition code there. Then you get ImageJ
integration for free.

Regards,
Curtis

P.S. The ImageJX mailing list has quieted down because the imagej-devel
mailing list has grown and become more of an external list. The name
ImageJX made more sense when we were discussing the idea of a new ImageJ,
whereas imagej-devel makes more sense now that we are actually doing it. I
have updated the mailing lists page (
<A HREF="http://developer.imagej.net/mailing-lists">http://developer.imagej.net/mailing-lists</A>) to reflect that. Sorry for the
confusion.

</I>&gt;<i> how that would be best implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think there is room/need for, or advantages in, having a nice

</I>&gt;<i> Would it be easy to provide just some simple interface (RMI ?,
</I>&gt;<i> FIFOs ?) which would enable external, possibly native applications to
</I>&gt;<i> send image data to ImageJ, for real-time display / processing /
</I>&gt;<i> capture ?
</I>&gt;<i> Should I just write yet another grabber plugin using the Java Native
</I>&gt;<i> Interface to talk to some native part ?
</I>&gt;<i>
