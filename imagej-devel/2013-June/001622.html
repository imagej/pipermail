<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi Chris,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I need instructions on how to do steps B through E.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You already have the clone on your workstation. You wouldn't have been able to push the README otherwise. You probably ran &quot;git init&quot; which actually *creates* the repository on your workstation, and then you ran &quot;git push&quot; which mirrors it back to GitHub. So you don't need to clone in that case; you already have a copy of the repo, since the workstation is where you created it.
</I>
OK, but I created the README on the website (<A HREF="https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards">https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards</A>), not with a terminal command.  When I then went through the instructions and tried to create the Hello-World README from the terminal, that's when I got the errors.  When I click the &quot;clone in desktop&quot; button on the github.com site, it takes me to the <A HREF="http://mac.github.com/">http://mac.github.com/</A> site where my only option is to download Git for Mac -- which I already downloaded.

&gt;<i> Step (D) is &quot;git commit&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Step (E) is &quot;git push&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The book and other Git tutorials have more information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are already really close -- you have the code on your local workstation, you have a GitHub repository already in existence, you have a local Git repository linked to that remote repository, so all you have to do is commit and push.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The errors you mentioned yesterday were because your local Git repository had the wrong URL for the GitHub remote. That's why I asked you to check the output of &quot;git remote -v&quot;. It should say your origin is &quot;<A HREF="https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards">https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards</A>&quot;. If it says &quot;Hello-World&quot; that is wrong. To fix, try this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> git remote rm origin
</I>&gt;<i> git remote add origin <A HREF="https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards">https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards</A>
</I>
This is the result of those commands in my terminal:

ChrisGAIAG:~ chris$ git remote rm origin
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
ChrisGAIAG:~ chris$ git remote add origin <A HREF="https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards">https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards</A>
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

So do I need to cd to some place first?

&gt;<i> Or, as Johannes says: just reclone from your GitHub remote into a new directory, and then copy your files into there, and then commit and push using the GitHub for Mac GUI.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't worry about &quot;screwing anything up&quot; because you can always just delete and recreate the repository. It's not like you're going to lose hundreds of hours of work, here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Curtis
</I>
The GitHub for Mac is a complete mystery right now.  There is a long list of my java classes and resources, followed at the end with a link to my NetBeans project folder, so I see there is a link to my computer.  I guess I am in fact close.  I just need to figure out how to commit and push.  

And of course, resolve the strange errors in my project that can't recognize the Swing components of my jFrames when I removed the APC_ class from my pom dependencies.  Now when I attempt to run it on my computer, I get this error:

Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/jdesktop/layout/GroupLayout$Group
	at A_Postcard.run(A_Postcard.java:25)
	at A_Postcard.main(A_Postcard.java:35)
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.jdesktop.layout.GroupLayout$Group

 Also, when I was able to run my project, I get an error that it could not find the class &quot;Versatile Wand&quot; which is in my project's target&gt;classes.
