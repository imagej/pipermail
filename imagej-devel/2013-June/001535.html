<PRE>Hi everyone,

The ImageJDev team has released the seventh beta of ImageJ2, version 2.0.0-
beta-7. This release achieves two key longstanding goals of the project:
unifying image I/O and better support for very large image data.

ImageJ 2.0.0-beta-7 is a &quot;beta&quot;-quality release, meaning the code is not
finished. The design is more stable than before but still subject to change
until the final 2.0.0 release. It is recommended that people continue to
use ImageJ v1.x for critical work.

The ImageJ2 user interface is modeled after ImageJ v1.x as much as
possible. However, under the hood, ImageJ2 is a complete redesign of
ImageJ. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ by
bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between &quot;legacy&quot; and &quot;modern&quot;
image structures.

Development of this release of ImageJ focused on better support for
N-dimensional data, particularly large datasets. This release adds support
for &quot;cell images&quot; which are similar to, but more powerful than, the
&quot;virtual stacks&quot; of ImageJ 1.x. There has also been a further strengthening
and stabilization of the ImageJ2 architecture, with the new plugin system
generalized into a SciJava Common library used by both ImageJ2 and SCIFIO.

For further details on this release, including a discussion of new
features, please see our blog post:

You can download the release from:

See the Downloads page for the updated table of planned future releases and
roadmap links for the project. The focus of the next release (2.0.0-beta-8)
is on better multidimensional image analysis and processing routines, such
as computation of measurements and statistics from ROIs.
