<PRE>Hi everyone,

The ImageJ launcher has been split to its own Git repository:

    <A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imagej-launcher">https://github.com/imagej/imagej-launcher</A>

The reasoning is two-fold:

1) The launcher is its own project with its own development cycle,
supporting ImageJ1, Fiji and ImageJ2. So it should be versioned separately.

2) The split makes it much simpler to build and release ImageJ2.

We have also released version 2.0.0 of the launcher [1]. It has been in use
with Fiji for a long time now, and we are already committed to maintaining
backwards compatibility, so unlike ImageJ2, there is no point to keeping it
in beta.

Regards,
Curtis

P.S. to Dscho: Updating the Jenkins jobs was mostly very straightforward,
except for the ImageJ-launcher-deploy job. Your recent hack to discover the
triggering Image-launcher build number by extracting it from the current
build log did not work as we hoped: there was no match. At first I thought
Jenkins was stripping out the backslashes within the sed expression, so I
tried escaping the backslashes, which fixed the Jenkins console output but
ultimately had the same result. So then I figured probably the log is not
actually written to disk at that point. I installed the Parameterized
Trigger plugin, added a buildNumber parameter to ImageJ-launcher-deploy,
and passed ImageJ-launcher's $BUILD_NUMBER in via that parameter. It
worked, and furthermore we now have the ability to manually execute
ImageJ-launcher-deploy on any desired ImageJ-launcher build.

P.P.S. to all: ImageJ 2.0.0-beta-7 will probably be out tomorrow, though
announcements and blog posts may not be finished before Friday.
