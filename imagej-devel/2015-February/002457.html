<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi Jan,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apologies for the delay in reply.
</I>
no problem, many thank for your reply!

&gt;<i>  &gt; I run into conflict between net.imglib2.meta.ImgPlus&lt;T&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; net.imagej.ImgPlus&lt;T&gt; now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That suggests a clash of dependencies. The &quot;net.imglib2.meta.ImgPlus&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> gone, in favor of (for the time being [1]) net.imagej.ImgPlus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everything should work if you update your POM to extend the newest
</I>&gt;<i> pom-imagej (5.10.0 at the time of this writing), and purge all &quot;import
</I>&gt;<i> net.imglib2.meta&quot; lines from your imports in favor of the new &quot;import
</I>&gt;<i> net.imagej&quot; class instead.  The HyperSliceImgPlus, though deprecated,
</I>&gt;<i> was updated to use net.imagej.ImgPlus, so hopefully this will work for you.
</I>
OK, thanks, I will check this.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; what should I use for the subsampling operations to do it properly?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The API for doing this is still under development. The Views.interpolate
</I>&gt;<i> method [2] is probably a good starting point, though it is rather low
</I>&gt;<i> level. If what you want is to resample an image, we should create an op
</I>&gt;<i> for that in the ImageJ OPS project (I don't think one exists yet).
</I>
I was using Views.subsample in my old code (all I needed was an integer 
subsampling), but was going to &quot;rather low level&quot; probably way too 
early. Thanks for the hint.

For the moment, I just took the algorithm and reimplemented it in 
ImageJ1 - I am much more familiar there and really needed to get the job 
done.

I will try to play with OPS and definitely, I will keep eye on its 
development  - it really looks great and evolves pretty quickly.

 &gt; [1] In case you are curious: the ImgPlus class really needs a better
 &gt; interface-driven type hierarchy, which has been a long time in coming.
 &gt; It is planned to rework the ImageJ2 data model a bit along these lines
 &gt; later this year.

This will for sure be interesting to follow!

Thanks again,

Jan
