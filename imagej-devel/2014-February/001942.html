<PRE>Hi Yili,

There are many more, in particular, you need to separate 2) into at least
3 subcategories: plugins that need a simple GUI enquiring parameters,
plugins that need a simple GUI with minor interactivity (such as
interpreting a &quot;maintain aspect-ratio&quot; checkbox to adjust the width if the
user edits the height, and vice versa) and fully interactive GUIs (think
Trainable Segmentation).

In general, all of these mentioned plugins are actually *commands*: they
*run*.

There are other plugins (even in ImageJ 1.x, where the term &quot;plugin&quot; gets
really, really blurred): tools, file formats for I/O, scripting languages,
complete user interfaces, etc.

&gt;<i>   Suppose this plugin will perform a long time-consumed task, so I want to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   1. will ImageJ2 run its plugin in a new thread? Because in Swing toolkit,

</I>
The idea in ImageJ2 is to avoid Swing-specific stuff (otherwise you doom
yourself to a very limited, narrow mindset: one user, one machine, one
desktop, something that is already not true at all).

So what you would do is subscribe to the event service and react to those
events.

&gt;<i>   2. If this plugin need its own GUI, but this plugin is running in a
</I>&gt;<i> thread which is not the UI thread (event dispatch thread), and this
</I>&gt;<i> plugin's GUI should be created in UI thread for thread safe, how can this
</I>&gt;<i> be done?
</I>
The same way as it is done with Swing: you subscribe to events and react
on them. If the reaction takes a long time, you will have to spawn off a
new thread to avoid blocking the main event thread.

&gt;<i>   In order to avoid blocking the ImageJ2' user interface, I plan to do like
</I>&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   1. execute the &quot;long time-consumed task&quot; in a separate worker thread;
</I>
Good idea.

&gt;<i>   2. In the task running process, I want to report the running progress to
</I>&gt;<i> the ImageJ2 main frame, so that the main frame can display a progress
</I>&gt;<i> information to let user know the current status;
</I>
Good. You will need to add a @Parameter field of type StatusService to do
that.

&gt;<i>   3. When the task completed, it can notify the main frame, and the main
</I>&gt;<i> frame can response to this event.
</I>
If you refer to the main window as the main frame, there is no need. If
you refer to your plugin's main frame, you'll just have to dispose() of
it.

&gt;<i>   How can I implement this asynchronous task model in ImageJ2? (I think
</I>&gt;<i> maybe I need some helper classes like  &quot;SwingWorker&quot; in JDK 6)
</I>
As I mentioned earlier, restricting yourself to Swing is bound to get you
into such a lot of trouble it is simply not worth it.

Better look at the ThreadService:

Ciao,
