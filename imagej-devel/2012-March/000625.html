Subject: ImageJ User and Developer Conference 2012: Call for Paper

Dear ImageJ Community,

we would like to invite you with this call for paper to an active 
participation on the 4th ImageJ
User and Developer Conference.

<A HREF="http://imagejconf.tudor.lu/call_for_paper">http://imagejconf.tudor.lu/call_for_paper</A>

The ImageJ User and Developer Conference 2012 follows the concepts of the
conferences organised in Luxembourg in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012. The 
event offers
workshops, in which the users will be able to improve their knowledge and 
usage of the
software. These workshops will cover &quot;beginner&quot; and &quot;user&quot; topics as well 
as &quot;advanced&quot;
topics focusing on the &quot;developer&quot; level. We try to specify the 
pre-knowledge of each
workshop as clear as possible. For the workshops, you should bring your 
own laptop, to be
able to test the course material on the own hardware. If this is not 
possible, workshop
computers are available.

Besides these workshops, shorter presentations are planned. These oral 
presentations are
limited to 15 min presentations (12 min + 3 min questions), case studies, 
projects, plugins
and solutions to common problems will be presented. The submitted and 
accepted
presentations will be grouped into topics, to introduce these topics a 
keynote will be given
by invited talks. We reduced the time frame duration to address the demand 
to have only
single session to give everybody the possibility to see all presentations. 
We ask you to
transfer the copyright for publishing of the accepted articles have to be 
granted to the
Centre de Recherche Public Henri Tudor.

Scientific posters and an expo area will accompany these presentations. 
Compared to
recent years, we will have more space for this part of the conference.
We are convinced that this conference will be again a &quot;meeting place&quot; for 
the community
to discuss the usage and the development with and of ImageJ. We remain 
open to every
additional idea for the conference. The format of the conference is not 
fixed, it can be
modeled by the ImageJ Community. Just drop us a message.

The conference team

P.S. Apologize if you receive teh mail several times.

</PRE>
