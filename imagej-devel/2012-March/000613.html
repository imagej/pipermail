<PRE>Hello!

I am a long-time user of ImageJ and am excited about ImageJ2, especially 
the new multi-dimensional components and the accessibility as a library 
(which I currently get around through system calls and transferring data 
through file read/write).

I was trying to follow the instructions online about building Image2 and 
ran the following on my machine:

git clone <A HREF="git://github.com/imagej/imagej.git">git://github.com/imagej/imagej.git</A>
cd imagej
mvn
cd ui/imagej

At this point, I am told that the folder &quot;ui/imagej&quot; does not exist.  Is 
there something I am doing wrong? I did not get and build errors and I 
poked around for other ways to try to launch, but with no luck.

I know this is a work-in-progress, but I'm still curious to try it.

Thanks!
-David Mashburn
