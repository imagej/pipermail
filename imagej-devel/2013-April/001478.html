<PRE>Hi Albert,

that should be no problem. You have any time to update it. What we plan to do is just move ImgLib1 into the SPIM_Registration until the entire migration is finished. This will take time, but it discourages new users from still using ImgLib1. You just have to update the TrakEM2 pom.xml to import SPIM_Registration instead of ImgLib1 until you finished porting your stuff.

If you have specialized implementations like ShapeList that do not really migrate to ImgLib2 well, I would just put it into TrakEM directly or into imglib2-algorithms-legacy. There I have some of my implementations that are not &quot;properly&quot; ported to ImgLib2.

Does that sound ok?

Bye bye,
Stephan

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as some of you may know, a precursor of our image processing library ImgLib2 (<A HREF="http://imglib2.net">http://imglib2.net</A>) exists, which is called ImgLib1. It still lives in Fiji and in the imglib repository. The plan is to get rid of it in both places within this week to finally migrate to ImgLib2 entirely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The plan is to integrate it into the SPIM Registration plugin which still makes heavy use of it to gradually convert it to ImgLib2 as well. So for people who still want to use it can do so by importing the SPIM Registration plugin and the jars will also be available for download on a webpage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If anybody has any objections to that please let us know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The 3d viewer (marching cubes) and TrakEM2 depend on ImgLib1. I will
</I>&gt;<i> have time to work on it this Summer, not earlier than August.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What needs to be done:
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Convert the Marching Cubes code in the 3D Viewer to use ImgLib2.
</I>&gt;<i> Should be easy and straightforward.
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Create a Shape (as in java.awt.Shape) planar Img, which TrakEM2
</I>&gt;<i> would then use to present collections of java.awt.geom.Area as an Img
</I>&gt;<i> to the Marching Cubes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have created twice the ShapeImg in ImgLib2 and both times it was
</I>&gt;<i> erased. I would appreciate if now you guys create it. It won't take
</I>&gt;<i> long. Put it in an ImgLib2 package that has java.awt dependencies.
