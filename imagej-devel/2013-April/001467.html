<PRE>Hi everyone,

Looks like these bug reports from Michael Schmid (from the ImageJ
2.0.0-beta5 release) slipped through my fingers. Sorry, Michael!

I am forwarding to the list so we have a public record.

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Curtis,

finally I had time to look at it - not bad at all!  Especially cleaning up
some Roi/overlay and 'composite image/channels' issues of IJ1 is good
approach!

Here are a few points that I have encountered - I have not delved into how
to create tickets in a formally correct way. If appropriate, could you
enter them or forward to someone for entering?

Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Auto-Contrast for 32-bit float images always gave an
incredibly high number as minimum (it seems to be Double.MAX_VALUE):
179,769,313,486,231,570,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
Obviously, then it does not display the image with reasonable contrast.
Also, large numbers like this should be displayed in exponential format.

Image&gt;Adjust/Brightness contrast does not accept exponential notation like
1e2 with lowercase 'e'.

Image&gt;Adjust/Brightness overrides the input if one has a small range for a
32-bit image (e.g. if I want to see the range 0 to 0.0001 in an image with
range -10 to 10). Then, if I want to set the minimum, it also destroys my
previous maximum setting, and other way round.

Image&gt;Adjust/Brightness Usability: A 'full range' or 'default' button
(brightness=50, contrast=50) would be welcome.

Analyze&gt;Histogram plot does not work for 32-bit float image

Image&gt;Duplicate should allow to enter the name of the copy and suggest a
NEW name as default, such as &quot;blobs-1&quot; for image &quot;blobs&quot;

Windows menu should list all open windows.

Currently, IJ2 keeps all selections; it's like IJ1 with the shift key
pressed when drawing further selections (at least under OS X 10.6.8, Java
1.6.0_35). I prefer the IJ1 behavior, that drawing a selection deletes the
old one(s) unless shift is pressed.
If you keep it like this, deleting an overlay/Roi must be easier: e.g.
right-click on it and have a context menu entry 'Delete overlay' or 'delete
selection'.

Selecting an image by clicking into it (while a selection tool is active in
the toolbar) should not create a new Roi (maybe unless the user drags to
extend the roi).  Even worse, clicking on the white space below an image
(if the window is larger than the image, such as for the 'Blobs' sample,
see also ticket #1060) currently also creates a new Roi.

On a German keyboard, the '+' key is currently mapped to 'Show all' instead
of 'Zoom in'. On this keyboard, it delivers the keyCode 93, which
corresponds to ']' on a US keyboard. Similarily, the '-' key does not work
for 'Zoom Out', because on a German keyboard it delivers keyCode 47, the
same as the slash on US keyboards. The Numpad + and - keys are ok.

Creating a selection on an image shown at a zoom level different from 100%
can cause the image to snap back to 100% zoom. (OS X 10.6.8, Java 1.6.0_35)

---

Sorry for the long list; but if I remember how many problems I have
reported on IJ1 it is still very short ;-)

Michael

&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ImageJDev team has released the fifth beta of ImageJ2, version 2.0.0-
</I>&gt;<i> beta5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ImageJ 2.0.0-beta5 is a &quot;beta&quot;-quality release, meaning the code is not
</I>&gt;<i> finished. The design is more stable than before but still subject to
</I>change
&gt;<i> until the final 2.0.0 release. It is recommended that people continue to
</I>&gt;<i> use ImageJ v1.x for critical work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ImageJ2 user interface is modeled after ImageJ v1.x as much as
</I>&gt;<i> possible. However, under the hood, ImageJ2 is a complete redesign of
</I>&gt;<i> ImageJ. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ
</I>by
&gt;<i> bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between &quot;legacy&quot; and
</I>&quot;modern&quot;
&gt;<i> image structures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Development of this release of ImageJ focused on the addition of scripting
</I>&gt;<i> support. The release was timed to coincide with the ImageJ conference in
</I>&gt;<i> Luxembourg, to ensure participants have access to a recent, stable
</I>&gt;<i> codebase. Since the development cycle for this beta was shorter than many
</I>&gt;<i> of our previous cycles, there are fewer new major features. But we have
</I>&gt;<i> made substantial progress on some big ticket items (such as multi-step
</I>undo
&gt;<i> and redo) that will be part of the next beta release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For further details on this release, including a discussion of new
</I>&gt;<i> features, please see our blog post:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can download the release from:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://developer.imagej.net/downloads">http://developer.imagej.net/downloads</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To more accurately reflect what is left to do, we have recently
</I>reestimated
&gt;<i> ImageJ2's release dates, and scheduled additional betas before the final
</I>&gt;<i> 2.0.0 release. See the Downloads page for the updated table of planned
</I>&gt;<i> future releases and roadmap links for the project. The focus of the next
</I>&gt;<i> release (2.0.0-beta6) is on robust core support for N-dimensional data,
</I>&gt;<i> including very large image data, and data/display decoupling.
