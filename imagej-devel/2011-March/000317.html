&gt;<i> Dear all!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I proudly announce a new version of Fiji (Fiji Is Just ImageJ -- batteries
</I>&gt;<i> included).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So: what is Fiji? It is just a distribution of ImageJ, i.e. putting a nice
</I>&gt;<i> and convenient infrastructure around ImageJ such as: automatic updates,
</I>&gt;<i> extensive documentation, a powerful yet small Script Editor, reusable
</I>&gt;<i> components for users and developers, bug tracking, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For details and downloads, see: <A HREF="http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/.">http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note: if you already have a Fiji installation, you can use the Fiji
</I>&gt;<i> Updater to upgrade; no need to download and install from scratch. Just
</I>&gt;<i> make sure that you update just the Updater first if you have not updated
</I>&gt;<i> in a long time, and update Java in the advanced mode (unless you are using
</I>&gt;<i> MacOSX).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In our beloved tradition, the current version is named after the location
</I>&gt;<i> of a big hackathon: Madison. It was not strictly a Fiji hackathon, but
</I>&gt;<i> the first ImageJ2 hackathon, made possible by Kevin Eliceiri and Curtis
</I>&gt;<i> Rueden. Nevertheless, quite some work on Fiji and its plugins got done,
</I>&gt;<i> so here goes &quot;Fiji Madison&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There have been more than 150 thousand lines added and 40 thousand removed,
</I>&gt;<i> with the help of (in alphabetical order):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Albert Cardona, Benjamin Schmid, Christian Tischer, Curtis Rueden, Daniel
</I>&gt;<i> James White, Daniel Sage, David Hovis, Francisco Jim&#233;nez Hern&#225;ndez, Gregory
</I>&gt;<i> Jefferis, Ignacio Arganda Carreras, Jacques Pecreaux, Jan Eglinger, Jan
</I>&gt;<i> Funke, Jean-Yves Tinevez, Johannes Schindelin, Kota Miura, Mark Longair,
</I>&gt;<i> Michael Doube, Philippe Th&#233;venaz, pogo, Robert Bryson-Richardson, Stephan
</I>&gt;<i> Preibisch, Stephan Saalfeld, Tobias Pietzsch, Tom Kazimiers, Wilhelm Burger,
</I>&gt;<i> Yili Zhao, and many other helpers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Changes since Fiji Heidelberg:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> New plugins
</I>&gt;<i> ===========
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Time Stamper plugin was much enhanced and eventually renamed into
</I>&gt;<i> Series Labeler, thanks to Daniel James White and Tom Kazimiers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The plugin &quot;TopoJ&quot; was added, thanks to David Hovis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A simple Graph Cut segmentation plugin was added, thanks to Jan Funke.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Two &quot;Macro Examples&quot; were added to demonstrate optical illusions which should
</I>&gt;<i> convince everybody that quantitative analysis of biological images is really
</I>&gt;<i> much better than looking at a red-green picture and convincing oneself that
</I>&gt;<i> there might be colocalized signals. Thanks to Daniel James White and
</I>&gt;<i> Gabriel Landini.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to a generous license by Michael Unser of the Biomedical Imaging Group
</I>&gt;<i> at the EPFL, the Differentials plugin, MosaicJ, Philippe Thevenaz' PointPicker,
</I>&gt;<i> his Shepp-Logan Phantom plugin, the StackReg plugin and the Snakuscule plugin
</I>&gt;<i> and Daniel Sage's plugin &quot;Extended Depth Field&quot; are distributed with Fiji now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to the generous license by Erik Meijering to distribute the source code
</I>&gt;<i> for a few of his plugins with Fiji, FeatureJ, RandomJ and TransformJ are
</I>&gt;<i> available in Fiji now, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Linear Kuwahara plugin was contributed by Christian Tischer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Daniel Sage's MIJ library to use Fiji/ImageJ from within Matlab is included
</I>&gt;<i> with Fiji now. Just add Fiji.app/scripts/ to the search path and call 'Miji'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Kota Miura contributed the Temporal Color Coder which makes a t-projection
</I>&gt;<i> color-coding the original time points.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bio-Format's bfopen.m was added to use Fiji's Bio-Formats from Matlab. Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> to Curtis Rueden.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The new 3D Blob Segmentation plugin allows interactive 3D segmentation in
</I>&gt;<i> the 3D Viewer backed by Fiji's level sets framework. Thanks to Erwin Frise,
</I>&gt;<i> Albert Cardona and Benjamin Schmid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mark Longair contributed plugins to calculate the curvature of n-dimensional
</I>&gt;<i> images, and to detect vessels according to Frangi's method.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Correct 3D drift script registers time frames using the Stitching 3D
</I>&gt;<i> plugin. Thanks to Stephan Preibisch, Robert Bryson-Richardson and Albert
</I>&gt;<i> Cardona.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Retinex plugin was added by Francisco Jim&#233;nez Hern&#225;ndez and Gabriel
</I>&gt;<i> Landini.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is now a plugin calculating the 'Shape Index Map', a per-pixel value
</I>&gt;<i> describing the shape of the height-field corresponding to the image.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is now possible to turn a binary image of points into a point selection,
</I>&gt;<i> by starting Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Points from Mask.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is now a plugin that saves the current image in EPS (Encapsulated
</I>&gt;<i> PostScript) format. Thanks to Wilhelm Burger.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Use &quot;Plugins&gt;Transform&gt;Panorama equirectangular view&quot; to look at 360&#176; panorama
</I>&gt;<i> photographs and pan around. Thanks to Stephan Saalfeld.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> User-visible changes
</I>&gt;<i> ====================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On Linux, the Fiji launcher will run even with older setups than the launcher
</I>&gt;<i> was compiled on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Bio-Formats plugins were updated frequently to include bug fixes and
</I>&gt;<i> improvements, e.h. support for the new LSM 710 format. Thanks to the LOCI
</I>&gt;<i> &amp; Glencoe team.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Debian packages are being rebuilt on a weekly basis now. This was a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of work competently completed by Mark Longair.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the course of Debianization, a number of licenses have been clarified.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On Linux, RAM will not be overcommitted anymore (this used to lead to serious
</I>&gt;<i> paging delays in multi-user environments).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fiji will now correctly identify 64-bit Intel CPUs on MacOSX.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Fiji launcher accepts --edit without paths now, opening the Script Editor
</I>&gt;<i> with a new, empty file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With newer MacOSX versions, the absence of the SECURITYSESSIONID does not
</I>&gt;<i> imply headless operation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When calling Fiji from a multi-platform Fiji.app/ directory, it will not
</I>&gt;<i> try to use the Java Runtime environment for another architecture.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Fiji launcher will interpret jvm.cfg before command line options so that
</I>&gt;<i> the user has a chance to override faulty settings. Thanks to Jacques Pecreaux.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On MacOSX, when the user specified &quot;Open in 32-bit mode&quot;, Fiji will no longer
</I>&gt;<i> ignore the user's wish. Thanks to Erwin Frise and Arthur Edelstein.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since many parts of Fiji's source code rely on Java 1.6 or better now, the
</I>&gt;<i> retrotranslator is activated automatically on MacOSX when only Java 1.5 or
</I>&gt;<i> earlier is available. Thanks to Mark Longair.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fiji will be able to use native libraries put into Fiji.app/lib/&lt;platform&gt;/.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Calling &quot;fiji-&lt;platform&gt; --updater&quot; calls a command-line version of the Fiji
</I>&gt;<i> Updater; this is useful in headless setups.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any script or macro can now live in any menu, by putting it into
</I>&gt;<i> Fiji.app/plugins/Scripts/. For example, if you want to have a macro in
</I>&gt;<i> File&gt;Import, you might save it to Fiji.app/plugins/Scripts/File/Import/.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As always, Fiji was synchronized frequently with ImageJ, and a few bug fixes
</I>&gt;<i> were contributed to ImageJ through Fiji. Thanks to Wayne Rasband.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fiji's bundled Java Runtime Environment is now at version 1.6u24 (to update,
</I>&gt;<i> run &quot;Update Java&quot; from Fiji Updater's &quot;Advanced mode&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Too many bug fixes and improvements to count in the TrakEM2 components. Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> Albert Cardona and Stephan Saalfeld.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Add the Plugins&gt;Examples&gt;Extended Profile Plot script to get profile plots
</I>&gt;<i> of closed polygons.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Add &quot;Scale to DPI&quot; function to Image&gt;Adjust menu, thanks to Curtis Rueden.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lots of bug fixes and improvements in the 3D Viewer. To name just a few:
</I>&gt;<i> orthoslice changes are now recordable, the animation axis can be specified,
</I>&gt;<i> the rotation step is adjustable, import/export for .stl files was added (for
</I>&gt;<i> 3D printers), the bounding box now has ticks, the transfer function is
</I>&gt;<i> adjustable, single objects are auto-selected, the current image is added
</I>&gt;<i> by default, ImageJ is no longer allowed to intercept key presses, multiple
</I>&gt;<i> 3D Viewers can be synchronized, there is now a &quot;Take snapshot&quot; menu item,
</I>&gt;<i> fullscreen mode, colorize meshes from given images, load/save landmarks
</I>&gt;<i> for all timepoints, make color of landmarks adjustable, etc. Thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> Benjamin Schmid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Analyze Skeleton plugin underwent many bug fixes and improvements, thanks
</I>&gt;<i> to Peter C. Marks, Huub Hovens, Michael Doube and Ignacio Arganda-Carreras.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fiji's Arrow Tool is now recordable and -- as was intended originally,
</I>&gt;<i> before ImageJ grew its own version of the tool -- gave rise to a generic
</I>&gt;<i> tool infrastructure allowing new tools to be developed more easily (and
</I>&gt;<i> using proper Java instead of macros).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Auto Threshold plugin supports 16-bit images now, too. This mode respects
</I>&gt;<i> the true 16-bit histogram rather than taking shortcuts. While at it, the
</I>&gt;<i> Huang method has been accelerated tremendously.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Scripting with the scripting languages is quicker now because ImageJ, Java
</I>&gt;<i> and ImgLib classes are imported by default when running scripts from the
</I>&gt;<i> Script Editor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Bug Submitter plugin collects more information in the bug report
</I>&gt;<i> automatically, to help developers understand the environment better. Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> to Mark Longair.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some bugs were fixed with Clojure scripting, thanks to Albert Cardona.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some errors were fixed in the Colocalisation_Analysis plugins, thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> Daniel James White.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Macro recording of the Directionality plugin was fixed, thanks to Jan
</I>&gt;<i> Eglinger.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fiji's handling of Help&gt;Refresh Menus has seen a number of bug fixes, as
</I>&gt;<i> well as Fiji's headless mode (which will stop being a clever hack with
</I>&gt;<i> ImageJ2, but instead be a proper solution).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For teachers' and instructors' convenience, Fiji can cache sample images
</I>&gt;<i> locally, avoiding huge network traffic during courses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When using the Recent Commands (available via the '9' key), the Recorder
</I>&gt;<i> properly records which action was chosen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to macros available as menu items, scripts are also opened
</I>&gt;<i> in the Script Editor rather than executed when holding down the Shift key
</I>&gt;<i> prior to opening the menu. While at it, the status of the main window tells
</I>&gt;<i> the user what is currently happening.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Fiji Updater now uses the system-wide proxy settings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By caching the checksums of the files, the Updater was speeded up dramatically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Updater is disabled when Fiji was installed via the Debian packages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Fiji Updater supports multiple Update sites now. If you have a web server
</I>&gt;<i> which you can access via SSH, you can publish your own plugin suites.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Image Expression Parser was fixed for a regression in ImageJ 1.44n and
</I>&gt;<i> later, as well as two bugs related to filename detection. Thanks to Albert
</I>&gt;<i> Cardona and Jean-Yves Tinevez.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The extra file type handling when opening images was fixed with regard to
</I>&gt;<i> the Bio-Formats plugin. Thanks to Curtis Rueden and Gregory Jefferis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to Albert Cardona, the Jython Interpreter now prints the last evaluated
</I>&gt;<i> expression return value.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Lasso/Blow Tool is more robust now, using the new AbstractTool framework
</I>&gt;<i> (thereby avoiding timing issues due to a macro handling all the mouse input).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Multiple Image Processor now resets Escape before starting, and it handles
</I>&gt;<i> .pgm files as claimed in the documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Compile &amp; Run command no longer needs write access to Fiji.app/plugins/,
</I>&gt;<i> and it offers to unlock images when appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A bug was fixed which prevented MBF plugins from being compiled and run on
</I>&gt;<i> the fly when a .java file was present in a subdirectoy of Fiji.app/plugins/.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Register&gt;Transform Virtual Stack Slices got a checkbox to toggle interpolation.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to Stephan Saalfeld.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Script_Editor can export scripts bundled in .jar files for other Fiji users
</I>&gt;<i> to install and run.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of templates have been added to the Script Editor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the script editor, the font and tab size can be adjusted. Thank you, Yili
</I>&gt;<i> Zhao.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Script Editor can auto-save before compiling now. Thanks to Philippe
</I>&gt;<i> Th&#233;venaz.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The output of multiple scripts in the Script Editor is now separate; you will
</I>&gt;<i> see the output only when the corresponding script's tab is active. Likewise,
</I>&gt;<i> the script interpreters running the scripts are now independent of each other.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the Script Editor is asked to open images, it lets ImageJ open them
</I>&gt;<i> rather than opening gibberish in a new tab. Thanks to Thomas Julou.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Script Editor is now usable even if the user updated ImageJ to the
</I>&gt;<i> daily version. Thanks to Wayne Rasband.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Script Editor offers to File&gt;Open Recent. Thanks to Albert Cardona.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The startup time of the Script Editor was reduced dramatically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the Script Editor, File&gt;Open will no longer offer to open .class or .jar
</I>&gt;<i> files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For interoperability, the Script Editor now enforces UTF-8 encoding for both
</I>&gt;<i> reading and writing files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When saving a new file, the Script Editor will default to the Fiji.app/
</I>&gt;<i> directory. This helps when trying to save macros on MacOSX, where the Save
</I>&gt;<i> Dialog does not allow switching into .app directories.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can ask the Script Editor to wrap the lines around instead of showing
</I>&gt;<i> a horizontal scrollbar. Additionally, it can label whitespace and zap gremlins,
</I>&gt;<i> thanks to Albert Cardona.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Simple Neurite Tracer can perform Sholl analysis and export the graphs as
</I>&gt;<i> .svg or .csv files now. Additionally, there were many fixes and improvements,
</I>&gt;<i> including an export as .swc option, or being able to select the path nearest
</I>&gt;<i> to the mouse pointer with the 'g' key. Further, selecting a path in the 3D
</I>&gt;<i> Viewer selects it in the Neurite Tracer, too. For convenience, there is a
</I>&gt;<i> button to run Fiji's &quot;Analyze Skeleton (2D/3D)&quot; plugin on the paths. The
</I>&gt;<i> user interface was converted to the nicer Swing look.  Thanks to Mark Longair.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The SPIM Registration can now handle multi-channel files, too. It provides
</I>&gt;<i> the cosine blending option and has many more improvements. Thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> Stephan Preibisch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Stitching plugins were speeded up, and it uses calibration info by
</I>&gt;<i> default now. Thanks to Stephan Preibisch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Thread Killer now unlock all images, and it is more careful about
</I>&gt;<i> what it offers to kill.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Trainable Segmentation plugin can handle image stacks now. Thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> Verena Kaynig, Ignacio Arganda-Carreras and Albert Cardona.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Particle Analyzer (3D) handles the case when there are less than 3 objects
</I>&gt;<i> now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Align image plugin uses the target image's dimensions for the result.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Segmentation Editor can be controllable by ImageJ macros. Thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> Benjamin Schmid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When zooming in the Three Panes, the right center point is used in all panes.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to Mark Longair.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When scripting, you can accelerate crucial parts by inserting Java code
</I>&gt;<i> snippets using the new Weaver.inline(...) method in any scripting language.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to Albert Cardona.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Several fixes and improvements in the mpicbg submodule for feature extraction
</I>&gt;<i> and transformation, e.g.:  Feature matching can be performed without geometric
</I>&gt;<i> consensus filter.  Geometric consensus filter got a new parameter, minimal
</I>&gt;<i> absolute number of inliers.  Added robust regression outlier filter to
</I>&gt;<i> TileConfiguration.  Several fixes and improvements to the CLAHE local contrast
</I>&gt;<i> enhancer, e.g.: Added a fast (real-time) version of the filter.  Fixed
</I>&gt;<i> selection handling.  Fixed transfer of values beyond the current min/max range.
</I>&gt;<i> Support CompositeImages in variable ways.  Added homogeneous least squares fit
</I>&gt;<i> for perspective transformations using Jama SVD.  Interactive transforms can
</I>&gt;<i> handle Composites, Stacks and HyperStacks.  Added a simple but comparably
</I>&gt;<i> fast Optic Flow variant based on the sum of square differences in a Gaussian
</I>&gt;<i> weighted neighborhood of a pixel.  Thanks to Stephan Saalfeld.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Developer-visible changes
</I>&gt;<i> =========================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There have been quite a few cleanups of the project structure; the sources
</I>&gt;<i> for plugins and libraries which are not contained in submodules are supposed
</I>&gt;<i> to live in src-plugins/&lt;jarname&gt;/&lt;package&gt;/&lt;classname&gt;.java, where &lt;jarname&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> is the base name of the generated .jar file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is now a script to compile and cross-compile ITK.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> JNA was extracted from Jython and JRuby so that a newer jna.jar can be used
</I>&gt;<i> without being shadowed by Jython's or JRuby's idea of JNA.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a helper now to compile a few ImageJ versions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have helper scripts to build cross-compilers on Linux 64-bit to target
</I>&gt;<i> win32, win64, MacOSX (32-bit and 64-bit Intel, 32-bit PowerPC).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a Fiji launcher for MacOSX PowerPC again, sadly not met with any
</I>&gt;<i> feedback from the complaining person, let alone positive one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have a script now to generate Eclipse, Netbeans and IntelliJ projects
</I>&gt;<i> from the master Fakefile.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FreeBSD is supported for developers, for now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a fall-back shell script -- fiji-other.sh -- for otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> unsupported platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The get-sample-images script supports headless operations now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To prevent long waiting times with &quot;git status&quot; when a number of submodules
</I>&gt;<i> are checked out, gitignore-in-submodules now understands an 'ignoredirty'
</I>&gt;<i> subcommand.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> bin/identify-commit.py can be used on the precompiled Fiji launchers, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In developer mode, the Updater's &quot;Show changes&quot; also lists changes for
</I>&gt;<i> the Fiji launchers and the .jar file's manifest.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When samples/ is present, it is included in generated Fiji.app bundles.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A convenience script was added to use Maven.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a helper now to find all dependencees (even transitive ones) of
</I>&gt;<i> a given .jar file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The nightly build generates a stable WebStart (reflecting the current version
</I>&gt;<i> according to the Fiji Updater) and the PluginList on the Wiki.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A simple script to reverse the page order of a .pdf file was added, as an
</I>&gt;<i> example how to use iText.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The helper script bin/ready-for-upload.bsh can determine whether all
</I>&gt;<i> prerequisite steps prior to uploading have been completed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The commons-math library from the Apache project is now available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fiji Build can now build JNI-backed plugins; just add .c or .cxx files to
</I>&gt;<i> a .jar rule, and a shared library of the same name as the .jar file will
</I>&gt;<i> be generated from the native sources. Use fiji.JNI.loadLibrary(&quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;) to
</I>&gt;<i> load the shared library.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Upgrade jfreechart to 1.0.13 (from 1.0.9).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Update JNA to version 3.2.7.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fiji contains a base class fiji.tool.AbstractTool which makes it easy to add
</I>&gt;<i> tools to the toolbar that are not backed by polling macros, but by a proper
</I>&gt;<i> event-driven Java class.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To generate tool icons from 16x16 pictures, use Plugins&gt;Examples&gt;Image To
</I>&gt;<i> Tool Icon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Auto Threshold plugin has an API usable by developers of other plugins
</I>&gt;<i> now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Fiji Build system handles rules involving Jython or Beanshell more
</I>&gt;<i> efficiently now. It avoids to include unwanted files such as .DS_Store into
</I>&gt;<i> .jar targets. The code uses generics now, and is more accessible to scripts
</I>&gt;<i> and plugins. Fiji Build can use multiple CPU cores simultaneously now.
</I>&gt;<i> A target can be force-rebuilt by appending &quot;-rebuild&quot; to the parameter.
</I>&gt;<i> Building rules depending on Java3D is now possible even on MacOSX.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to Mark Longair, Jacques Pecreaux and Curtis Rueden.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is an easy way for developers to run external programs now:
</I>&gt;<i> fiji.SimpleExecuter. This class offers a number of convenience functions
</I>&gt;<i> to execute programs with specified parameters in a given working directory,
</I>&gt;<i> and it offers several modes how the output should be handled: print to
</I>&gt;<i> ImageJ's Log window, print to a stream, or save into Strings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For Fiji Developer, adding documentation to the Fiji Wiki has been made
</I>&gt;<i> even more convenient with enhancements to Plugins&gt;Utilities&gt;Fiji&gt;New Fiji
</I>&gt;<i> Tutorial and New Fiji Wiki Screenshot in the same menu.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The file and directory fields in the GenericDialogPlus class have been
</I>&gt;<i> improved, and the methods addImageChoice() and getNextImage() have been
</I>&gt;<i> added.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> fiji-lib now offers a class to split command lines and macro option strings,
</I>&gt;<i> and a TicToc helper for simple performance benchmarking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to add functionality similar to ImageJ's Command Finder to your
</I>&gt;<i> own code, you can use fiji.util.gui.CommandFinderBase. If you have a JMenuBar
</I>&gt;<i> you want to make accessible, you can use the JFrameCommandFinder class in
</I>&gt;<i> the same package straight away. Thanks to Benjamin Schmid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When looking at a specific file and number in a developer checkout of Fiji,
</I>&gt;<i> the Script Editor offers to open that particular location via gitweb in
</I>&gt;<i> the web browser (this helps collaboration via IRC, for example).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The submodules have been moved into the modules/ directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can use the short-cut URL <A HREF="http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/&lt;filename">http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/&lt;filename</A>&gt; for
</I>&gt;<i> source files in Fiji's Git-managed repositories.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Added IntegralImages as library components to the mpicbg submodule for
</I>&gt;<i> rapid box-filter operations (mean, scale, difference of mean, ...).  Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> to Stephan Saalfeld.
