<PRE>Hi Jean,

&gt;<i> @Curtis, in your answer to Alexandra, what do you mean by &quot;It would be
</I>&gt;<i> best for TANGO to be distributed via an ImageJ update site, which are
</I>&gt;<i> only supported in ImageJ2&quot; ?
</I>
I was responding to Alexandra's statement at the beginning of the thread:

&gt;<i> One of the developers of TANGO told me to use ImageJ1 because he
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't sure how the switch between libraries is managed.
</I>
I understand that Tango has an official update site, which is great! What I
meant is that I think update sites are the best way to distribute complex
plugins like Tango&#8212;and update sites only work with ImageJ2, not ImageJ1.

Hence, the advice to &quot;use ImageJ1&quot; struck me as odd. Based on my
conversation with Alex in another thread, I think there was some confusion
about what constitutes &quot;ImageJ1&quot; vs. &quot;ImageJ2&quot;, which has hopefully been
cleared up.

&gt;<i> for some reason in her system (macosx64) only tango is updated and not
</I>&gt;<i> mcib (but it works properly in my system, linux64). Any clue about
</I>&gt;<i> what the problem might be?
</I>
I took a look at the Tango update site, and noticed a couple of problems:

1) TANGO's platform-specific libraries are not in the correct locations. TANGO
ships its libraries in lib/Linux64, lib/Win64 and lib/Mac64, which will not
be added to the java.library.path properly.

- 64-bit Linux libraries should go in lib/linux64
- 64-bit Windows libraries should go in lib/win64
- OS X libraries should go in lib/macosx

You can verify this for yourself on each platform by running &quot;ImageJ-xyz
--dry-run&quot; and noting the value of the &quot;-Djava.library.path&quot; argument.
E.g., on my OS X system, it is:


  -Djava.library.path=/Applications/Fiji.app/lib/macosx:/Applications/Fiji.app/mm/macosx

2) TANGO's lib/Mac64 directory does not have any OS X native libraries in
it. I'm not sure whether this is intentional, though.

3) The TANGO update site does not ship any mcib libraries. You can verify
this by running Help &gt; Update..., changing the View Options to &quot;View files
of the 'Tango' update site&quot; and typing &quot;mcib&quot; into the Search box.

I downloaded <A HREF="http://sites.imagej.net/Tango/db.xml.gz">http://sites.imagej.net/Tango/db.xml.gz</A> and searched it for
&quot;mcib&quot; and the string does not appear. This means that in fact, no files
with &quot;mcib&quot; in the name have ever been uploaded to the Tango update site.

Perhaps the reason TANGO works on your Linux system is that you have the
mcib library present in a different directory of the java.library.path?
Perhaps a system-wide installation? You may want to test on another fresh
Linux system, rather than only your developer system.

HTH,
Curtis

</I>&gt;<i> For the moment our pugin Tango is distributed under FIJI via an official

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Jean
</I>&gt;<i>  Dear Alex and IJ2 developers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TANGO uses its own library for image processing and object analysis. We
</I>&gt;<i> use ImageJ and IJ1 mainly for opening images and drawing Rois of our 3D
</I>&gt;<i> objects as a overlay of the image. We would be happy to discuss more about
</I>&gt;<i> integration of TANGO into IJ2 . For completeness if you want to add plugins
</I>&gt;<i> into TANGO (filtering, segmentation, or measurements),you can use our own
</I>&gt;<i> MCIB library. We however already provide basic functions to exchange image
</I>&gt;<i> data between TANGO and IJ1, maybe we should write, using some help, basic
</I>&gt;<i> data exchange between TANGO and IJ2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS : in copy the main developer of TANGO, Jean
