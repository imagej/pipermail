<PRE>Hi Lee,

Two years later!

&gt;<i> I've tried using TableDisplay as an input and it works adequately, but
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to conform to the standard and avoid creating two ways of
</I>&gt;<i> asking for table inputs and outputs.
</I>
In the short term (by some definition of &quot;short&quot;...), it is fine to use
either TableDisplay or ResultsTable as an input. I agree it is annoying to
have two ways of asking, but that is the current situation with the API as
things stand.

In the longer term, the next design iteration of the SciJava display model
will eliminate the Data/DataView/Display/DisplayViewer stack in favor of
something much simpler [1]. Then we will just have ResultsTables&#8212;it would
be rare indeed to need any sort of TableDisplay as input.

&gt;<i> future developers might suffer from the ambiguous nature of
</I>&gt;<i> TableDisplay - which of the tables should be used for an operation if
</I>&gt;<i> there are more than one?
</I>
Yes, I think it was a mistake to make Displays be Lists. That will be
remedied in the next design iteration: a Display displays one thing at a
time. If you need a Display that shows a list of things, type it on a List
and support that on a per-Display basis.

&gt;<i> The problem with using ResultsTable as an input is that it's not
</I>&gt;<i> registered in the ObjectService.
</I>
That is a good point. Right now the reference counting stuff is part of
Data/AbstractData, so anything built on that inherits the reference
counting. We might want to do reference counts for tables so that we can
manage them in the ObjectService. Another possibility would be to enhance
the ObjectService to support weak references for some things, so reference
counting stops being needed&#8212;that comes with its own dangers though.

Filed an issue for it!

&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps this could be done in AbstractDisplay and be similarly applied to
