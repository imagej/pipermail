Subject: [ImageJ-devel] org.jdesktop.layout.GroupLayout not found in Maven
Message-ID: <BF89EDDD-BD19-4819-97B3-1FB3CE33B227@gaiag.net>

I am trying to develop my project in Maven, but I am getting errors for every occurrence of org.jdesktop.layout.GroupLayout, and searching the Maven Repositories finds no matching items.  How do I get my Swing GUI to work with Maven?

Thanks in advance for any help.

Thank you Curtis.  I do have java 1.6 on my machine in System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk, but I cannot add it to Netbeans.  Choosing Add Platform in Tools>Java Platforms (there is no just "Platforms" in NetBeans IDE 7.3) results in this dialog:



which doesn't allow me to do anything but cancel.  The same holds true if I try this with NetBeans 7.2.  I tried copying java 1.6.0.jdk to the same library where jdk1.7.0_21.jdk is located, but it still doesn't allow anything but "Cancel."   So it seems I do not have the ability to change NetBeans java platform to 1.6.0.

Maybe there is something about "compatibility"? Even later JDKs will allow
you to target earlier versions. With javac, the option is "-target 1.5".
With Netbeans, I don't know.

This solves the class format problem, but of course it does not safeguard
you against using API that was not yet available in earlier Java versions
(e.g. java.io.File missing setExecutable(boolean), i.e. all the stuff that
is marked with something like "Since 1.6" in the javadocs).

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Chris,

> which doesn't allow me to do anything but cancel.

Does it allow you to proceed if you select the Contents/Home subfolder?

> I tried copying java 1.6.0.jdk to the same library where
> jdk1.7.0_21.jdk is located

I would strongly caution you against manually copying Java files around on
OS X. If you hose your setup, it may be very difficult to repair.

Hi all,

Congratulations to the ITK team!

Of particular interest (to me ;-) is this:

This has been several years in the making; kudos to Matt McCormick, Mark
Hiner, Gaetan Lehmann and the whole ITK team for making it happen! And
thanks to FARSIGHT and Kitware for making development of this module
possible!

Regards,
Curtis

Message-ID: <CADN69ymg6XimPRyGeEJ+66AxJ9d6gsetaQzeVjf2n1Ci5=9O5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

The ImageJ 2.0.0-beta-7 release is nigh. However, there is one remaining
problem: a slight configuration bug with nar-maven-plugin and the ImageJ
launcher.

The problem was revealed by the rename from maven-nar-plugin to
nar-maven-plugin, and corresponding bump of the plugin version to
3.0.0-scijava-1.

The following output illustrates the gist of the misconfiguration:

--snip--
$ cd launcher && mvn help:effective-pom | grep -B 1 -A 10 maven-nar-plugin
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-nar-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.1-20120403</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>default-nar-integration-test</id>
            <phase>integration-test</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>nar-integration-test</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
          <execution>
--snap--

So somehow, one reference to maven-nar-plugin remains (and to release
version 2.1-20120403 at that, which was last explicitly referenced in the
2.0.0-beta1 release!).

Hopefully we can quickly iron out this niggling reference to fix the build,
and start testing 2.0.0-beta-7 release candidates!

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Curtis can you guys help us with the CZI format? It's the Zeiss image format and we are having some difficulties with it.

Congratulations to the ITK team!

Of particular interest (to me ;-) is this:

This has been several years in the making; kudos to Matt McCormick, Mark Hiner, Gaetan Lehmann and the whole ITK team for making it happen! And thanks to FARSIGHT and Kitware for making development of this module possible!

Regards,
Curtis

The InsightToolkit (ITK) 4.4.0 has been released!

The 4.4 release is a major milestone that marks the hard work of many
outstanding community members.

Links to the Sourceforge.net<http://Sourceforge.net> tarballs can be found on the download page:

  http://www.itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html


We will discuss what is new in 4.4.0 on Tuesday, June 11 at 3PM
Eastern Time (GMT -5).  To take part, join the ?ITK BarCamp?
GooglePlus Community, and join the ?What?s New in Release 4.4.0?
Event.  A link to the YouTube live stream of the event will also be
posted at

  http://www.itk.org/ITK/resources/webinars.html


In summary:

We are excited to announce two new ImageIO modules available in the
main repository.  The MINC ImageIO module provides a bridge to the
MINC file format, a powerful medical imaging format used by the MINC
library, another open source library with many features similar to
ITK.  The new MINC module, which has Image IO and Transform IO
capabilities, is considered experimental and must be enabled by
turning Module_ITKIOMINC ON in CMake?s configuration.  This will
automatically build the MINC library, which is now available on Mac,
Linux, and Windows.  The HDF5-based MINC2 file format is supported,
but support for the NetCDF-based MINC1 file format is not supported
because NetCDF is not distributed with ITK.

Another new ImageIO module that expands the reach of ITK is the SCIFIO
module.  SCIFIO is a refactoring of the Bio-Formats library.  This
module provides access to a wide range of file formats encountered in
life sciences/microscopy environments.  This experimental feature is
available a Remote module; to enable it, set the Fetch_SCIFIO CMake
variable to ON.  Many improvements and fixes are ongoing for this
module; Git master is recommended for those interested in this module.

A number of improvements were also made to DCMTK ImageIO, but this
module remains experimental on disabled by default.  To try DCMTK
ImageIO support, turn the CMake option Module_ITKIODCMTK ON.  For Unix
platforms, the supporting DCMTK library will automatically be built as
a CMake ExternalProject.  On Windows, the DCMTK library must be built
independently of the ITK build system.  Then, specify the location to
the external build after setting the CMake option ITK_USE_SYSTEM_DCMTK
ON.

A number of performance improvements were made to QuadEdgeMesh
processing and memory copy functions.  A new ImageScanlineIterator is
available.  This iterator can be used in many of the cases where an
ImageRegionIterator is applied, but it has better performance.

The approach to split image regions for parallel processing is no
longer hard coded to make multiple options available.

An API design change was started to improve the implied functionality
of the GetObject methods.  The non-const ?GetObjectMacro? has been
replaced with a ?GetModifiableObjectMacro? that will result in a
GetModifiableXXX method instead of a GetXXX method.  This makes the
non-const nature of the method and the circumvention of pipeline
update semantics explicit for both the code author and those reading
the class API.  This was implemented in a backwards compatible way,
and it will only be enforced if ITK_FUTURE_LEGACY_REMOVE is defined.

Support for the Google Double Conversion library was added to improve
the reading and writing of double values as ASCII text with the
intention to improve the precision of the text transform file format?s
serialization.

It is now easier to identify filter inputs by both a string name or an
integer index.  The internal methods to store and retrieve inputs by
either string or index was correspondingly refactored, and performance
was also improved.

JPEG ImageIO now writes and reads image spacing in a manner similar to
the TIFF ImageIO.

An extensive amount of code cruft was removed and coding style was
made more consistent; ITK gets more stylish and classy with every
release!

The ExternalData method to store large testing data outside of the Git
repository is now in upstream CMake 2.8.11.  Our internal version has
been updated to the improved version in CMake.

The minimum CMake required version was bumped to 2.8.8 on Windows and
2.8.5 otherwise.  This may be increased even higher in the near future
to ensure all CMake features utilized operate correctly.

Known assertion failures occur when compiled under Visual Studio in
the Debug configuration.  This will be fixed in 4.4.1.  If this has a
significant negative impact on your work, please consider contributing
a Nightly dashboard build under this configuration.  As previously
scheduled, Visual Studio 2005 is no longer be supported.

Support for building against system third party libraries continues to
improve.  Further improvements are expected for version 4.5.

All tests are now passing again on the Nightly big-endian dashboard system.

InsightApplications (ITKApps) has seen fixes in the FLTK superbuild
and the TCL wrapped applications.

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] ImageJ launcher split to its own repository
Message-ID: <CADN69y=NWc5XyTVoQGTEw17Y+jBr4gG1pPc-4WRtvj7P+msV4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

The ImageJ launcher has been split to its own Git repository:

    https://github.com/imagej/imagej-launcher

The reasoning is two-fold:

1) The launcher is its own project with its own development cycle,
supporting ImageJ1, Fiji and ImageJ2. So it should be versioned separately.

2) The split makes it much simpler to build and release ImageJ2.

We have also released version 2.0.0 of the launcher [1]. It has been in use
with Fiji for a long time now, and we are already committed to maintaining
backwards compatibility, so unlike ImageJ2, there is no point to keeping it
in beta.

Regards,
Curtis

P.S. to Dscho: Updating the Jenkins jobs was mostly very straightforward,
except for the ImageJ-launcher-deploy job. Your recent hack to discover the
triggering Image-launcher build number by extracting it from the current
build log did not work as we hoped: there was no match. At first I thought
Jenkins was stripping out the backslashes within the sed expression, so I
tried escaping the backslashes, which fixed the Jenkins console output but
ultimately had the same result. So then I figured probably the log is not
actually written to disk at that point. I installed the Parameterized
Trigger plugin, added a buildNumber parameter to ImageJ-launcher-deploy,
and passed ImageJ-launcher's $BUILD_NUMBER in via that parameter. It
worked, and furthermore we now have the ability to manually execute
ImageJ-launcher-deploy on any desired ImageJ-launcher build.

P.P.S. to all: ImageJ 2.0.0-beta-7 will probably be out tomorrow, though
announcements and blog posts may not be finished before Friday.

Good point.

BTW I found one problem with the deployment: I forgot to use
-DupdateReleaseInfo=true in ImageJ-launcher-deploy.

While at it, I looked through all the configurations and found that
Bio-Formats-maven, cppwrap-maven-plugin, curve-fitter, deep-zoom-plugin,
flow-cytometry, forward-cron-job, ImgLib, ImgLib-daily, jar2lib, jvmlink,
loci-checkstyle, LOCI, LOCI-daily, loci-utils, misc-plugins, multi-lut,
native-lib-loader, ome-versioning, prairie-ome-tiff,
Saalfeld-MPICBG-Maven, SCIFIO, SLIM-curve, slim-plotter, slim-plugin,
TrakEM2-Maven, visbio, visbio-imagej, wid-3dniche and wiscscan-java share
the same problem.

I fixed them all, even the disabled (and the obsolete) ones, so that the
following command would give me an empty result:

grep -w 'deploy' $HOME/jobs/*/config.xml |
grep -v -e '-DupdateReleaseInfo=true' -e 'incremental-deploy' \
	-e '</\?description>' -e '<projects>' -e '<command>#' |
sed 's/^[^:]*\/\([^\/:]*\)\/config\.xml:.*/http:\/\/jenkins.imagej.net\/job\/\1\/configure/'

That is too bad. I actually tested this in the Sandbox and the first part
of the log *was* written to disk at that point.

I agree that is much better than my hack! Sorry to cause you so much
trouble, I would have worked harder on this (and on the split) had I
not expected all of that to happen next week ;-)

Sounds good to me!

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] ImageJ 2.0.0-beta-7 released
Message-ID: <CADN69ykppMjkTZO=u-pteCswwS89CHQ_rH90zpE1fH4DK2bi1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

The ImageJDev team has released the seventh beta of ImageJ2, version 2.0.0-
beta-7. This release achieves two key longstanding goals of the project:
unifying image I/O and better support for very large image data.

ImageJ 2.0.0-beta-7 is a "beta"-quality release, meaning the code is not
finished. The design is more stable than before but still subject to change
until the final 2.0.0 release. It is recommended that people continue to
use ImageJ v1.x for critical work.

The ImageJ2 user interface is modeled after ImageJ v1.x as much as
possible. However, under the hood, ImageJ2 is a complete redesign of
ImageJ. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ by
bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between "legacy" and "modern"
image structures.

Development of this release of ImageJ focused on better support for
N-dimensional data, particularly large datasets. This release adds support
for "cell images" which are similar to, but more powerful than, the
"virtual stacks" of ImageJ 1.x. There has also been a further strengthening
and stabilization of the ImageJ2 architecture, with the new plugin system
generalized into a SciJava Common library used by both ImageJ2 and SCIFIO.

For further details on this release, including a discussion of new
features, please see our blog post:
  http://developer.imagej.net/2013/06/12/imagej-v200-beta-7

You can download the release from:
  http://developer.imagej.net/downloads

See the Downloads page for the updated table of planned future releases and
roadmap links for the project. The focus of the next release (2.0.0-beta-8)
is on better multidimensional image analysis and processing routines, such
as computation of measurements and statistics from ROIs.

For more details on the ImageJ developments, see the web site at:
  http://developer.imagej.net/

I?m trying to use the Segmentation Editor on a PC (Windows 7).  But when I try
to use the adjust threshold window as shown by your video demonstration,  the
application freezes and the sliding bar keep blinking.  I find that a lot of
people have this problem.

Dear ImageJ Developers,

I downloaded the latest version of imageJ2 beta 7, and created a very 
simple program to run imageJ as follows:

public static void main(String args[])
{
     final ImageJ ij = imagej.Main.launch(args);
}

Unfortunately I failed to do so (check full output below).
Apparantly it is not able to locate the following class:
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: io/scif/io/img/ImgIOException
must I include an additional library?

I had to create the io.scif jar file to solve this issue. I think it 
would be nice to be included in the next release in the jars folder.

A couple of comments:

- if you want to use ImageJ2 as an application, please use the ImageJ
  launcher instead of writing your own main() method.

- if you want to use parts of ImageJ2 as a library, please use Maven. The
  problem you got:

> java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: io/scif/io/img/ImgIOException

  is exactly the problem Maven was designed to solve.

  If you insist on adding each required dependecy to the classpath
  yourself, that is something you can easily do, but it is your
  responsibility, then, to find and list all of the required .jar files.

- to get started on using ImageJ2 as a library, please have a look at the
  imagej-tutorials:

	https://github.com/imagej/imagej-tutorials

  in general, it is a bad idea to use the launch() method from your code:
  it is meant to be used via the command-line. From Java, you would
  instantiate the context yourself:

	ImageJ ij = new ImageJ();
	ij.ui().showUI();

Ciao,
Johannes

Message-ID: <A5BEC9FF-2490-478F-90D7-AB03A1ED4784@gaiag.net>

Hi, 

I am trying to debug a macro in Fiji, and since I upgraded to the latest version, I no longer see the menu options when the macro window is selected, so I can no longer use the debugging feature.  Is this a known or fixable problem?

I use a Mac PowerBook Pro OS 10.7.5, ImageJ 1.47t, java 1.6.0_45 (64-bit).

Are you talking about the Script Editor? (File > New > Script)

If so, on my system, the menus are at the top of the Script Editor window,
rather than integrated with the Mac screen menu bar. See this screenshot:

http://curtis.imagej.net/script-editor-menus.png

Of if you mean ImageJ's built in macro editor, which was previously
accessible via File > New > Text Window, I notice that that now also brings
up a Script Editor window when running an up-to-date Fiji. That might
technically be a bug; for the time being, you can work around it by using
Plugins > Macros > Edit and opening your macro that way, which will bring
up the macro editor rather than the Script Editor.

HTH,
Curtis

Thanks for the clarification. I am CCing the mailing list, so this bug is
properly described in a public forum.

Dear Developers,

I want to try out setting Rois of the imglib2 (ex.

Not so much can be found by googling, can someone please offer me some

Hi Christian,

I just noticed that our KNIP Git-SVN mirror cannot reach your Subversion
server any longer:

	http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/KNIP-Git-SVN-Mirror/20/console

Known issue?

Ciao,

I came across the imageJ tutorial LoadAndDisplayDataset, it is a nice 
start but I still cannot add RegionOfInterest to the dataset (displayed 
image), I tried with Overlay so that I can add them as OverlaySerivce 
through imageJ.overlay() but Overlay is not abstract as it was in ij 1. 
I can only getRegionOfInterest but there is no set method. Can anyone 
show me a small example on how to add a RegionOfInterest please?

Sure. I added a new tutorial:
https://github.com/imagej/imagej-tutorials/tree/master/add-rois

However, be warned: the ROI/overlay API is one of the least stable APIs of
ImageJ2 at the moment, and is very much subject to change in future betas.

That said, have fun. :-)

I am terribly sorry for ignoring this thread for so long. I notice that you
have now posted a similar announcement as a GitHub issue, which is great.
For those interested, we can discuss in the comments there:

Hi Aivar,

I agree; we should put this in to AxisType. We can do it on the pending
img-metadata branch [1].

I think the plan is to build a layer on top of ImgLib2 (a CalibratedViews
static utility class, probably) that can do things like detecting when an
Img has attached Axis metadata with a discrete dimension, and create
sub-Imgs at each discrete sample. Then you can execute whatever
dimension-agnostic algorithm you want on those sub-Imgs without clobbering
the discrete dimension(s), as you say.

I think both of your examples could be handled in this way, potentially.

Indeed, I am also not certain exactly what my proposed layer would look
like. I agree that it would be ideal to have some convenient way of
specifying which (types of) dimensions are of interest when subdividing
images. There may also be an argument to passing the entire Img rather than
a sub-Img, if the "non-interesting" dimensions are rather "interesting for
decision-making but not to be operated upon directly." I don't know.

Hopefully we won't have to go that route... custom types are powerful but
also incompatible with the wealth of code already in existence that uses
regular types.

Curtis

Dear Curtis,

Thank you for all these great tutorials you wrote.
I had been struggling all day to find a way to listen to mouse clicks on 
the images, without success. The new ImageCanvas of 
imageJ.data.display.ImageCanvas no more has the addMouseListener method. 
Can you please tell me how to achieve this?

Best Regards,

Message-ID: <CAHLFyjejCErybR-kjJkiOduQWWDcUOBYW=-1tXFr-200WY0fZw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm planning to write a cubic spline Interpolant as part of an upcoming
project. The class would be backed by a RandomAccessible which would supply
two pixel values on either side of the real coordinate to be sampled, per
dimension. One of the neat features of cubic splines is that you can take
their first derivative (gradient) and second derivative (Hessian) with the
same efficiency as calculating the interpolation, so it makes sense to have
methods that return separate RealRandomAccess instances for both the
gradient and Hessian.

The natural type for a gradient is a vector and the type for a Hessian is a
tensor (NxN matrix, roughly), so there are some interesting choices to be
made for the type for the corresponding RealRandomAccess classes. Does it
make sense to have a VectorType<T> and TensorType<T>? I could be
over-thinking this - it would be easier to replace the gradient and tensor
RealRandomAccess classes with methods:

T gradient(int dimension);

T hessian(int dimension, int dimension);

and maybe the JIT has an easier time optimizing too. Also, implementing
VectorType ... extends NumericType ... is probably starting to turn into
more work than I can justify for the project but the utility of that is
obvious.

I'll turn this into an issue on github.com/imagej/imglib after it becomes
clear what needs to be done.

Message-ID: <CAHLFyjf5f9SaST6HCi-jF566w3Ny-T=bJf8wNmXxZP5hJ68Y9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
As part of an upcoming project, I'm planning to implement the methods
described in

Unser, The L2 Polynomial Spline Pyramid, IEEE Transactions on Pattern
Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol 15 # 4, April 1993, p 364 (
http://bigwww.epfl.ch/publications/unser9305.pdf)

There are two operations, one that decimates an image by half to generate a
smaller image (REDUCE) and one that reconstructs the larger image from the
smaller (EXPAND). I'd implement both operations as classes supporting the
RandomAccessible interface.

Do people think that these have enough utility to add to imglib2 (and where
should they go?) or is it more appropriate to keep them within the project
itself?

How about in algorithms/core? (Or if GPL licensed: in algorithms/gpl?)

Package prefix: net.imglib2.algorithm.somethingOrOther? (I leave the choice
of "somethingOrOther" to you since I know how much you love naming! ;-)

What do others think?

Hi Lee,

I think that sounds useful ... can you explain exactly how you want to implement it? It seems like it could work on and return a RandomAccessibleInterval on which one can instantiate RandomAccesses. There could be even two implementations of it. One that precomputes it and one that always computes it on the fly, just when the RandomAccess actually queries a value.

What do you guys think?

Cheers, Steffi

putting the computational logic into a class, Kernel1d, that holds the

calculate the intermediate 1d convolutions on a scratchpad RandomAccessible
or RandomAccessibleInterval.

public <T extends NumericType<T>> void reduce(IterableInterval<T> src,
IterableInterval<T> dest, ImgFactory<T> factory);

There are several flavors of methods that use this, but I think the one
that I will end up using in my plugin is:

public <T extends NumericType<T>> RandomAccessibleInterval<T> reduce(Img<T>
src);

which will use the factory of src to create a scratchpad Img for
intermediate calculations and for the output image. One neat thing is that
it should automagically work with Img<ARGBType> ooo score one brownie point
for a good design Stephan.

I won't use it, but I'll probably figure out an easy way to generate a
RandomAccessibleInterval, given a source RandomAccessible and a
destination. Also, since it uses a kernel, the pixels along the output's
border are undefined. The method I plan to use returns an interval defined
only over valid pixels, but a dogged and misguided user should be able to
use some out of bounds strategy to get bogus pixel values along the border.

Isn't that what the net.imglib2.view.Views.interval methods do?

Oops - not destination, a coordinate. Something like:

RandomAccessibleInterval<T> randomAccessibleInterval(RandomAccessible src)
{}

with a get() method that calculates the value at the currente location.

Hi Lee,

>> public <T extends NumericType<T>> void reduce(IterableInterval<T> src, IterableInterval<T> dest, ImgFactory<T> factory);

It seems to me that you should rather take as input RandomAccessibleInterval than IterableInterval. You can simply make it iterable by calling
-- public static < T > IterableInterval< T > iterable( final RandomAccessibleInterval< T > randomAccessibleInterval ) 
from the net.imglib2.view.Views class -- but not really the other way around. Or is there any good reason why it should not work on a RandomAccessibleInterval?

Btw, be careful when you work with temporary images and Intervals. Temporary images always start at (0,0, ... 0), Intervals not. Happened to me several times that it actually worked when you take an Img as input to test, but not a View with an offset.

>> Isn't that what the net.imglib2.view.Views.interval methods do?

Yes ... check out the static Views class, has almost everything you need https://github.com/imagej/imglib/blob/master/core/src/main/java/net/imglib2/view/Views.java 

Bye bye,
Steffi

Hmmm... I can have a RandomAccessibleInterval as the source. I totally

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Moving histogram1d to core?
Message-ID: <51C2F40E.6050109@gmx.de>

Hi all,

With the introduction of histogram1d our own (much simpler) histogram 
implementation becomes obsolete. Therefore
we want to migrate the ops that rely on it to histogram1d and remove 
OpsHistogram.

However as histogram1d is currently in the project imglib-algorithms and 
Ops has no dependency towards algorithms this is
not possible.

I would therefore suggest to move the histogram package either to ops or 
to core. Core might be the better solution?

Looking forward for your thoughts

Michael

Hi all,
I was thinking it would be nice (= makes my life a little easier) if
imglib2-io was a test phase dependency of imglib-algorithms so you could
use test images in imglib2 tests. I'm thinking of storing very small .tifs
as resources in the test packages, hope 100x100 pixels is a reasonable size
for GIT, still haven't figured out the best strategy for writing the
resource to a file so that it can be loaded.

Hi,

I am using Netbeans 7.3 to develop ImageJ plugins, but I am no longer able to see my plugins in the Plugins menu.  The tutorials available online are for earlier versions of Netbeans and no longer work.  Has anyone found a way to set up Netbeans 7.3 to display plugins in the Plugins folder of the instance of ImageJ that results from running or debugging the project?

Thanks for any help.

Hi Chris,

We're using Netbeans 7.2 and the way we do it is like this:

     public static void main(String args[]) {
----snip-----
              // Development, doesn't work outside IDE
              if (args[i].equals("-d")) {
                  isDeveloping = true;
                  System.getProperties().setProperty("plugins.dir", 
"lib/plugins");
                  System.getProperties().setProperty("macros.dir", 
"lib/macros");

              }
---blah blah blah----

So, this main() is defined as the "Main Method" in 
Project->Properties->Run and also in the properties we pass the "-d" flag

It is quite possible this is a stupid way, but it is a way...
I should also say that this system property is set before an instance of 
ImageJ is created.

Collin

I think that's a good idea. However, a couple of comments:

1) net.imglib2:imglib2-io:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT will go away soon, in favor of
io.scif:scifio:0.3.0. In other words: the latest ImgOpener/ImgSaver work is
being done in the SCIFIO repository (https://github.com/scifio/scifio)
rather than in the ImgLib2 repo. The reason is that imglib2-io already
depends on SCIFIO to do this stuff, and SCIFIO depends on imglib2 core, so
why not consolidate and give all SCIFIO users the capability of working
with ImgLib2 data structures?

So, imglib-algorithms would then have a test-phase dependency on scifio.
Same difference though.

> I'm thinking of storing very small .tifs as resources

2) Rather than TIFFs, you can use .fake file paths for testing without
needing to commit any actual images to the repository. The .fake "file
format" was invented for exactly such a purpose, to make unit testing easy.
The only downside is that you can't precisely control the pixel contents,
but for unit tests you rarely need to. Rather, you typically want the test
to verify that it processes data in various structures properly (RGB vs.
grayscale, huge plane sizes, etc.).

Would that work for you?

Regards,
Curtis

I am actually surprised that nobody picked up on my idea of
quickly-generated test images:

	https://github.com/imagej/imglib/blob/master/core/src/test/java/tests/JUnitTestBase.java#L197

This would have the huge advantage of not cluttering any source code with
binary images, growing the repository to unwieldy sizes.

Ciao,
Johannes

I'll look at pulling in scifio instead or possibly hold off on committing
the tests until things gel a bit more.

> For the pyramids, I want to compare the output of the C reference
implementation against my own. That means that I have to generate the
results using an image with known contents. Johannes suggested generating
test images. In CellProfiler, I often do similar - use a pseudo-random
number generator with fixed seed to generate the same image every time. I
was planning to include the reference implementation outputs (there are six
different variants = 6 outputs), but perhaps it's enough to randomly sample
the values at a handful of coordinates and check those instead of checking
the entire image.

For CP unit tests, we have a standard set of images that we use throughout
the tests (stored in an svn repository, not GIT). ImageJ has those example
images and maybe those are enough for testing.

Hello Self,

After further thought I realized that no one should do what I suggested. :)

You can do a similar thing by passing VM arguments ( again in 
Project->Properties->Run ) like:

-Dplugins.dir=lib/plugins/ -Dmacros.dir=lib/macros/

Note there's an implicit path to the root of the Netbeans project in the 
args above.

Cheers,
Collin

Well, with Maven it would be easy enough to have a profile that drags in
certain dependencies only conditionally. That way, we could have a
repository that is meant to bloat. If the tests now call
"Assume.assumeTrue(file.exists())" before using "file", we're all set.

Message-ID: <56268A82-32F3-4A78-97FA-986C4E939D46@mpi-cbg.de>

Hi,

ok, sorry for the lurid subject line - it's not that bad, but I think the "incorrect" part is kind of important.


First regarding the slow (feel free to skip to this paragraph...). I played with unsigned short to ARGB conversion and noticed that it divides by scale factor for every pixel.
I thought that maybe we could speed it up a little by replacing that with a multiplication. Amazingly even in a language as Java that is seemingly far removed from the CPU this actually matters.
I have pushed a RealARGBConverterBenchmark which uses cursors and a converter to convert a UnsignedByteType image to ARGBType, https://github.com/imagej/imglib/commit/fbdf633a8b6d1c2894f9ef08eb3a642c010ca44e
Replacing the division to multiplication (and some minor tweaks) made the benchmark go from 28ms to 12ms, https://github.com/imagej/imglib/commit/5c6f40f0492bee2159eebe1ffb1e5b5f1bcc6a8d. Amazing.
Then I wanted to do that for all of the converters, got side-tracked, and as usual the 10-minute thing turned into 2 hours obsessing with details: is the converter math actually correct?


I think the linear range conversion in the Real*Converters is wrong.
Mathematically, it is obviously simple. We have to intervals [minA, maxA] and [minB, maxB] and want to convert (linearly) xA to xB:
xB = minA + (xA - minA) / (maxA-minA) * (maxB-minB)
Thats exactly whats implemented in, for example, RealUnsignedByteConverter.
Where it gets tricky is quantisation.

In RealUnsignedByteConverter:
output.set( Math.min( 255, roundPositive( Math.max( 0, ( ( a - min ) / scale * 255.0 ) ) ) ) );
Stripping the bounds check:
output.set( roundPositive( ( a - min ) / scale * 255.0 ) );
where roundPositive is just normal rounding, and scale = (maxA-minA) as above and 255.0 = (maxB-minB).
I think, the roundPositive is supposed to take care of quantisation.

Now let's look a simplified example where we want to convert a 4-bit value into a 2-bit value.
Intuitively I would expect the converter to perform a uniform re-binning. There are 16 4-bit values that need to be distributed into 4 2-bit bins.
What should happen is that we keep the upper 2 bits of the 4-bit value, that is:
0000-0011 map to 00
?
1100-1111 map to 11
At least that is what my intuition tells me.
Now if you go through the motions with the current converter logic you'll find that 1100 actually is mapped to 10. Likewise, 0011 is mapped to 01. There are 2 bins with 3 values each and 2 bins with 5. Not uniform.

I think this is wrong and I would fix it, but first I wanted to ask whether I'm missing something here?
Especially, Stephan, maybe you can comment because you implemented current logic.


best regards,
Tobias

Just wanted to point out that this particular surprise with division, in
Java, I've run into before. Another aspect of it: for whatever reason the
compiler or JIT are unable to map divisions by powers of two to a bit
shift. For example:

int d = 16;
int a = 4096 / d;

... is about substantially slower (15 to 50%) than:

int s = 4;
int a = 4096 >> s;

... to the same result.

Hi,

I've been thinking more about the problem.

When we scale down (for example 4-bit to 2-bit) I think it's clear what has to happen. Like described below, just throw away the lower 2 bits, i.e., multiply by 1/4.
The scale factor 1/4 = 16/4 is obtained as the ratio of the *exclusive* max values (16 and 4) of the 4 and 2 bit range.
If we assume exclusive range maxima, then the formula
xB = minA + (xA - minA) / (maxA-minA) * (maxB-minB)
does just the right thing for the quantized case.

However, when scaling up, i.e., 2-bit to 4-bit, it looks a bit different.
When we do as above we end up multiplying by 4, and map
00 -> 0000, 01 -> 0100, 10 -> 1000, 11 -> 1100
So we do not use the full range of the target interval.

Here, it actually seems that we want to use the formula with *inclusive* range maxima.
Then we get scale factor 5 = 15/3, and map
00 -> 0000, 01 -> 0101, 10 -> 1010, 11 -> 1111
which seems better to me.

So, what do we do? Case distinction for scaling down and up?
Is there any canonical right way to do this? Does anyone know?

best regards,
Tobias

Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP3299D9825BD95D651E341EAA28A0@phx.gbl>

Dear Developers,

from inside my code I am calling imageJ through

ImageJ ij = new ImageJ.Main.launch();

If I use this instance to open an lsm image with 2 channels, the image 
isn't loaded properly, only one channel is visable and trying to split 
channels will ask me for arguments and won't be done.
Note that opening the imageJ from the provided executable works fine. I 
suppose the launch method needs some arguments to be passed. Can you 
please show me an example to how to do this?

Best Regards,
M. Tleis

I have set up ImageJ in Netbeans according to instructions at 

http://developer.imagej.net/netbeans#Install_and_configure_NetBeans

However, the instructions only show how to set up Netbeans.  There are no instructions demonstrating how to develop plugins, e.g., where in the resulting ImageJ Projects project do I develop my java files?  

This is the project structure after completing the Developing ImageJ in Netbeans instructions:



If I wanted to write, say, a "Hello World" java class, where do I write it so that is shows up in the ImageJ plugins menu when I run or debug from Netbeans to generate the ImageJ instance?

Thank you.

As I said, this is not the correct way to launch ImageJ.

First of all, ImageJ.Main.launch is not a class, therefore you cannot
instantiate it with "new". Second, the correct call to obtain an ImageJ
context is:

	final ImageJ ij = new ImageJ();

Please have a look at the examples Curtis put so much TLC and effort into:

Please have a look at the examples here:

	https://github.com/imagej/imagej-tutorials

Most of these projects do not implement plugins but instead show how to
use ImageJ2 and its plugins.

I will add examples for plugins as time allows, but here is the simplest
"Hello World" I could come up with:

I think all of this is caused by pom-scijava not being found, but I can
actually see that it was deployed on Jun 13:

http://maven.imagej.net/content/repositories/releases/org/scijava/pom-scijava/1.48/

Can you make sure that your Maven finds the appropriate (non-default)
repository?

Ciao,
Johannes

This magically resolved itself after re-starting Netbeans the next day.  Sorry about that...  :-)

What I need is where to build my .java files so that they get properly compiled into class files that show up in the plugins folder of the ImageJ instance created by Netbeans when run or debug is called in the project.  The Netbeans project has two main folders, Modules and Project Files, but I don't see where I should create my .java files and where to put my resources folder containing images used in the GUIs.

You do not need to build ImageJ itself when you use Maven. In fact, it is
much better to use the version of ImageJ deployed to the Maven repository,
*unless* you want to fix a bug or otherwise enhance ImageJ itself.

I will have a look and try to come up with a screencast.

Yes, I know that, I only need to build my project.

Here is the screencast:

	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac-6gJ2eRb0

It shows in a very detailed manner how to clone the template for ImageJ
1.x plugins and how to adjust, build and run the project.

In order to copy my built plugin directly to the imageJ/plugins folder; 
I was trying to set the imagej.app.directory in the POM file as follows:
         <properties>
<imagej.app.directory>/usr/share/imagej/plugins</imagej.app.directory>
         </properties>
Netbeans automatically trys to copy the compiled jar to "jars" folder 
inside the specified directory. Do you have any idea how to configure 
Netbeans to copy to plugins instead of jars?

Previously in this list, another user faced the same issue, but the 
solution was not discussed.

Sorry I haven't mastered all the intricacies of Netbeans, so I can't answer your question, although I suspect it may be addressed with a change in the script of your build.xml file.  However, this would be a great improvement for my project too, so if someone is kind enough to provide an answer, I would be grateful if you could share the solution with me.  :-)

Thanks,

Chris Coulon

ImageJ.app is the directory containing the plugins/ directory. Not the
plugins/ directory.

This helps other people having the same question, and myself not having to

That is correct. You have to ask the UIService to show the user interface.
Otherwise, truly headless operation would be impossible! And that was an
express goal of ImageJ2: to be modular enough so as to make it as useful
as possible.

As I said, ij.ui().showUI() should do it.

Hi Mohamed and everyone,

I agree with Johannes that using "new ImageJ()" is better for programmatic
use, in that it is more flexible. That said, there is nothing "wrong" per
se with calling "imagej.Main.launch()" if what you really want is for the
ImageJ application to pop up. So no worries there.

As for your reported problem, I have a couple of questions:

> If I use this instance to open an lsm image with 2 channels

Please note that ImageJ2 does not support LSM out of the box. You need
either Bio-Formats or LSM_Reader for that (which at the moment are ImageJ1
plugins, and will be run using the IJ2's legacy layer). If you open an LSM
with File > Open right now, I believe it will open as a vanilla TIFF file,
which may not read all the metadata, and may misinterpret some
Zeiss-specific image parameters.

> Note that opening the imageJ from the provided executable works fine.

Hmm, you mean if you launch ImageJ2 from the launcher, then open your LSM
file, it behaves as expected? Then there may indeed be a bug lurking here
somewhere. Do you have a sample non-working image file you can upload via
the Help > Upload Sample Image command? That, along with specific brief
instructions about what doesn't work, would be very helpful to diagnose and
fix the problem.

Thanks,
Curtis

I am bit confused on what you are trying to accomplish. Are you trying to
develop plugins for ImageJ 1.x, the current stable release used by many
thousands of scientists -- or ImageJ 2.x, for the next generation of
N-dimensional image data, which is still in beta?

Please note that material on developer.imagej.net is all about ImageJ2,
whereas material on imagej.net is all about ImageJ1. For more details on
the differences, please see: http://developer.imagej.net/flavors

The screencast that Johannes recently created (
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac-6gJ2eRb0) is all about developing ImageJ1
plugins, which is probably a better target for algorithms you want to get
into the hands of many users ASAP. [1]

Regards,
Curtis

[1]  Fiji will soon support ImageJ2 commands out of the box, but it does
not do so yet. Until ImageJ2 comes out of beta, ImageJ1 is a more stable
development target for plugins, unless you need ImageJ2's new features for
your work.

Hi Chris,

> ImageJ 1.x is what I'm developing my project in.

OK. Please note that Mohamed is developing against ImageJ2, so answers to
his questions are probably not applicable to you, then. If you have a
specific question about NetBeans + ImageJ1 that you would like addressed,
feel free to reframe it here and we can try to help.

Regards,
Curtis

P.S. I updated the front page of http://developer.imagej.net/ to be clearer
about the nature of these two projects.

OK, thanks.  The screencast that Johannes recently created (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac-6gJ2eRb0) is working for me now -- at last!  Thank you Johannes and thank you Curtis!  :-)  

I don't understand how to change the name of the jar file created in the Netbeans build.  It currently builds a jar file called APC_.jar.  The only place I can see that name is in the pom.xml in my project's Project Files.  



If I change that name to anything else, I get errors in all my java files that use a JFrame Form.  The error is :

package org.jdesktop.layout does not exist

even though the swing-layout-1.0.3.jar (which contains org.jdesktop.layout) is in my project dependencies.  So if I change the artifactId to anything else, or if I change the version from 1.0.0 to 0.1.0, I get the errors.



So in my Projects under Dependencies I have the APC_.jar with its version (APC_-1.0.0.jar), while in my Files>target:



I have A_Postcard-0.1.0.jar -- the name of my project and the name of the jar I prefer.  

Is there any way to name the jar file in the Dependencies A_Postcard?

Thanks.

Chris Coulon

As shown in the screencast, just change the <artifactId> of the project
itself. Note that this is *not* one of the <artifactId> values within the
<dependencies> block, but rather the <artifactId> immediately beneath
<project>, towards the very top of the POM.

Also as shown in the screencast, after editing your POM, NetBeans should
magically update itself to match the new information there. In my
experience, it works pretty well, but if you run into trouble, try quitting
and restarting NetBeans.

You must add a dependency to the proper GAV in your POM. In this case, it
is:

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.swinglabs</groupId>
  <artifactId>swing-layout</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.3</version>
</dependency>

In general, to search for dependencies, you can use the site:

    http://maven.imagej.net/

I don't know where that APC_ artifact came from, but I suggest you remove
it, since it is not an actual dependency of your project.

I also highly encourage you to read through the following article to get an
overview of the Maven POM, as well as how to locate needed dependencies for
your project:

    http://fiji.sc/Maven

Curtis

Hmm. It would be easier to help if you had this on GitHub: that way, I
could quickly check it out, make fixes and open a pull request with
detailed commit messages.

Any chance you can put it on GitHub?

Of course.  If you could show me how to do that, I would be delighted! :-)

The <artifact> of the project is already changed in line 15:



The problem lies between lines 27 and 32.  Should I delete those?

Well, it magically updates with the errors if I change line 29 from APC_ to A_Postcard, but yesterday I got odd errors which magically went away when I restarted Netbeans.

These errors do not occur with the pom.xml as shown above, and the project runs with Netbeans debug or run, but again, nothing appears under the ImageJ plugins menu, even though there are several classes with underscores in their names.  Also, in the Files>target (which is grayed out) the classes contain both class and java files and there are two jar files, A_Postcard-0.1.0.jar and Process_Pixels-1.0.0.jar.  The A_Postcard contains a small test class that just says, "It works!" when run, and I deleted that file right after I setup and tested my new project, so clearly that A_Postcard-0.1.0.jar file is a residue from when I first set up the project yesterday.

I don't know either.  Should I remove lines 27 through 32, i.e.,

	 <dependency>
	  <groupId>sc.fiji</groupId>
	  <artifactId>APC_</artifactId>
	  <version>1.0.0</version>
	  <type>jar</type>
	 </dependency>

Removing it gives me the org.jdesktop.layout.GroupLayout errors again, and adding the dependencies

> <dependency>
>   <groupId>org.swinglabs</groupId>
>   <artifactId>swing-layout</artifactId>
>   <version>1.0.3</version>
> </dependency>

does not get rid of the errors.  The errors go away only if I replace the lines to the screenshot above.

OK, I read it and am trying to understand how it relates to my problem...

I set up ad1054/Postcards on GitHub, but I don't see how to put my project there.

Hi Chris,

> The problem lies between lines 27 and 32.  Should I delete those?

Yes. That is erroneous. I have no idea what APC_ is, or why you would want
to depend on it. Delete it.

> it magically updates with the errors if I change line 29 from APC_ to
A_Postcard

Your project is A_Postcard. You do not want it to *depend* on A_Postcard,
because then it would be depending on itself, which would obviously be an
error.

> even though there are several classes with underscores in their names

Your artifactId needs an underscore, so that the JAR has an underscore,
which it does have. But you still need a plugins.config, too. Did you edit
the plugins.config as shown in the screencast?

> I set up ad1054/Postcards on GitHub, but I don't see how to put my

Read the guide, step 3, "push your commit":

It was simply my old name for the project.  I deleted it, but now I have the errors again:



> Your artifactId needs an underscore, so that the JAR has an underscore, which it does have. But you still need a plugins.config, too. Did you edit the plugins.config as shown in the screencast?

Yes.  My plugins.config looks like this:

# Name: A_Postcard
# Author: The GAIA Group
# Version: 0.1.0


File, "Postcard", A_Postcard

OK, clearly I'm lost here.  I clicked the "Create repository" green button when the default Public was selected, but I do not see any terminal type window as shown in the Create A Repo page.  I don't know how to get to the prompt that allows me to create and commit my README file or push my commit.

Sorry Curtis, now I understand I should be using my Terminal.  Sometimes I have to ask a silly question before I can discover the answer for myself!  :-)

Hi Chris,

Great, I see that you have a repo at:
https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards

If you can push your actual project there (using "git add" and "git commit"
and "git push") that would make it much easier to diagnose your continuing
problems.

Regards,
Curtis

I went through all the steps in the Create a Repo page, but it was only created on my computer.  

I am not really succeeding at the tutorial.  I created the Hello-World file on my computer, but get an error when following the "Push your commit" instructions:

ChrisGAIAG:Hello-World chris$ git remote add origin https://github.com/ad1054/Hello-World.git

Yep, I can see that repository, complete with a .gitignore and a
README.md.

That must be a left-over from some previous iteration that failed.

This says that you *already* added a remote with "git remote add".
However, the URL is wrong: there is no repository called Hello-World on
https://github.com/ad1054/.

Probably at this stage, the easiest will be to clone your own repository.
This will create a local clone of the repository which is connected to the
remote repository via the nick name "origin".

The local clone consists of the working directory (which is called
"Postcards" if you cloned as I mentioned above) and the local repository
which lives in the .git/ subdirectory of the working directory. Do not
change anything manually in that .git/ subdirectory until you have a
profound understanding of Git!

If you have a Mac, why don't you use GitHub for Mac?

If you have Windows, why not use GitHub for Windows?

OK, I do use Mac and I set up GitHub for Mac -- thank you!  

This is my pom 



It looks like line 52 is not right.  Shouldn't the main class be >A_Postcard< ?  If so, should I just type that in?  Sorry for asking, but I don't want to start making changes and create a big mess...

Chris

Hi Chris,

> >A_Postcard< ?  If so, should I just type that in?

The mainClass you specify there is what will be run when you execute the
JAR (with e.g. "java -jar A_Postcard-0.1.0.jar"). If the class specified
there does not exist, you will receive an error when attempting to execute
the JAR.

So, if you want it to work, then fix it.

OK, in GitHub for Mac I see my repository:

Repositories>A_Postcard 

and in that:

~/NetBeansProjects/A_Postcard

and selecting that shows a pom.xml file which is different from the NetBeans project on my Mac PowerBook Pro (my local pom).  How do I change the main class in the GitHub?  It does not allow me to type anything in the GitHub pom.xml.  I have already made the changes in my local pom.

To do the clone, should I follow the directions at GitHub help's Fork A Repo, which says to Step 1: click the "Fork" button, Step 2: clone your fork , Step 3:Configure remotes, etc.?

Thanks for your continued patience!  :-)

I know,.  I'm still lost and do not want to start trying things without knowing what I'm doing.  For example, I tried:

ChrisGAIAG:~ chris$ git clone ad1054/Postcards
fatal: repository 'ad1054/Postcards' does not exist

so I don't know the correct commands.  I can see my repository at https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards, but following the instructions at https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo doesn't work . The first step is to fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button, which does nothing.  So I can't really proceed in cloning my repository when I can't get past the first step.

Hi Chris,

>  following the instructions at
>  https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo doesn't work .

The article you want is:
https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo

*not* the one on forking a repo. The forking article is when you want to
make a copy of someone *else's* repository and work on your copy of it. In
your case, it is your own repo that you control. So you need to:
A) create the repo on GitHub (you did this already)
B) clone it to your local workstation (that's what "git clone" does; you
can also do it via GitHub for Mac or other UI)
C) hack on the local copy on your workstation
D) commit your changes, which is like taking a snapshot so you don't lose
work
E) push your commits back to the remote server, so others can see what you
did

Pushing your changes back to GitHub is also nice in case your computer
explodes, so you don't lose any work. You won't even lose the *history* of
your work since the entire thing is there on the server. (And the entire
thing is there on you local workstation -- that's why it's called a
"clone").

> I'm still lost and do not want to start trying things without knowing

I strongly suggest you take the time to read up on Git so that you have a
basic understanding before you flail around too much. It will save you a
lot of frustration.

I did this article and created the README yesterday, which created a Hello-World folder on my computer with a .git and a README file.  I couldn't commit or push the commit due to the errors I sent you yesterday (remote origin already exists).  But that article is only about creating a repo and creating and pushing a README file.  It says nothing about cloning to my local workstation.

Hi Chris,

> I need instructions on how to do steps B through E.

You already have the clone on your workstation. You wouldn't have been able
to push the README otherwise. You probably ran "git init" which actually
*creates* the repository on your workstation, and then you ran "git push"
which mirrors it back to GitHub. So you don't need to clone in that case;
you already have a copy of the repo, since the workstation is where you
created it.

Step (D) is "git commit"
Step (E) is "git push"

The book and other Git tutorials have more information.

You are already really close -- you have the code on your local
workstation, you have a GitHub repository already in existence, you have a
local Git repository linked to that remote repository, so all you have to
do is commit and push.

The errors you mentioned yesterday were because your local Git repository
had the wrong URL for the GitHub remote. That's why I asked you to check
the output of "git remote -v". It should say your origin is "
https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards". If it says "Hello-World" that is
wrong. To fix, try this:

git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards

Or, as Johannes says: just reclone from your GitHub remote into a new
directory, and then copy your files into there, and then commit and push
using the GitHub for Mac GUI.

Don't worry about "screwing anything up" because you can always just delete
and recreate the repository. It's not like you're going to lose hundreds of
hours of work, here.

Regards,
Curtis

So you don't need to clone in that case; you already have a copy of the repo, since the workstation is where you created it.

OK, but I created the README on the website (https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards), not with a terminal command.  When I then went through the instructions and tried to create the Hello-World README from the terminal, that's when I got the errors.  When I click the "clone in desktop" button on the github.com site, it takes me to the http://mac.github.com/ site where my only option is to download Git for Mac -- which I already downloaded.

This is the result of those commands in my terminal:

fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
ChrisGAIAG:~ chris$ git remote add origin https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

So do I need to cd to some place first?

The GitHub for Mac is a complete mystery right now.  There is a long list of my java classes and resources, followed at the end with a link to my NetBeans project folder, so I see there is a link to my computer.  I guess I am in fact close.  I just need to figure out how to commit and push.  

And of course, resolve the strange errors in my project that can't recognize the Swing components of my jFrames when I removed the APC_ class from my pom dependencies.  Now when I attempt to run it on my computer, I get this error:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/jdesktop/layout/GroupLayout$Group
	at A_Postcard.run(A_Postcard.java:25)
	at A_Postcard.main(A_Postcard.java:35)
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.jdesktop.layout.GroupLayout$Group

 Also, when I was able to run my project, I get an error that it could not find the class "Versatile Wand" which is in my project's target>classes.

Well, Git has no idea that you want to clone from GitHub: you specified
the local directory ad1054/Postcards as repository to clone. But it does
not exist...

> so I don't know the correct commands.  I can see my repository at

You did not want to fork the repository. You already have a beautiful
repository. It is called "fork" when, quote:

	you may find yourself wanting to contribute to someone else's
	project, or would like to use someone's project as the starting
	point for your own. This is known as "forking."

FWIW I took this quote from the second paragraph of this page:

	https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo

> So I can't really proceed in cloning my repository when I can't get past
> the first step.  

So close, but no cigar ;-)

The second step suggests how to clone your repository (even if your
repository is not a fork: it *is* the original project, not started from
someone else's).

In the above-referenced page, it says in Step 2: Clone your fork:

	You've successfully forked the Spoon-Knife repository, but so far
	it only exists on GitHub. To be able to work on the project, you will
	need to clone it to your local machine.

So again, while you do not have a forked repository, you do have a
repository. And as they point out, so far it only exists on GitHub. To be
able to work on the project, you will need to clone it to your local
machine.

How?

They say this:

	Run the following code:

	$ git clone https://github.com/username/Spoon-Knife.git

Of course, this is not *exactly* what you should do. First, you should not
type that dollar sign followed by a space. This is a common way to refer
to shell commands on the web, imitating the prompt of Unix Terminals.
Second, it is not your repository. So what you will have to run is

	git clone https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards

There are other ways to clone, too, e.g. a very convenient one via the
GitHub for Mac application, but since you decided to go the hard route...

Ciao,
Johannes

This was meant to help you on the notion that you have familiarized
yourself with Git a bit rather than following the instructions in the
create-a-repo article slavishly.

Although, you most likely did not follow the article *all* that slavishly.
Since you already had the 'origin' remote, there is no way that you
followed step 1:

	mkdir ~/Hello-World
	cd ~/Hello-World
	git init
	touch README

followed by step 2:

	git add README
	git commit -m 'first commit'

followed by step 3:

	git remote add origin https://github.com/username/Hello-World.git
	git push origin master

Besides, in your mail you indicated that you really copy-pasted that "git
remote" command a couple of times. It will fail from the second time on.

Further, you should not have followed those instructions mindlessly: since
you did *not* create a repository on GitHub called 'Hello-World' as they
suggest before step 1, but rather a repository called 'Postcards', the
'git remote' call in step 3 should of course specify a URL ending in
Postcards.git, not in Hello-World.git.

The page I linked to yesterday has detailed instructions on step B at
least. And I would really be surprised if they did a bad job for steps C,
D and E.

So I am looking at http://mac.github.com/help.html now.

"Cloning a repository" sounds like it might be covered in "Working with
repositories":

	https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-repositories

And sure enough, "cloning" is handled here:

	https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-repositories#cloning

In the section after "Cloning", called "Celebrate", there is a link to
learn how to "make changes and commit them" which is suspiciously close to
what Curtis referred to as C and D, respectively:

	https://help.github.com/articles/making-changes

A-ha! Indeed, the first part of that page shows you how to open the
working direcory of the just-cloned repository in the Finder! That's good!
So now, you could make changes to that directory.

Including copying the files and directories from the directory that
contains your Postcards project.

Now, I never used GitHub for Mac, but I conjecture that those files would
show up as "untracked" files that GitHub for Mac lets you add to the
repository ("track") and commit.

As to D, I think that http://mac.github.com/help.html#faq-sync-push-pull
should answer that question (FWIW I went back to the first help page of
GitHub for Mac, which is something you could always do if you do not find
the information you seek on another page).

There is also the very informative GitHub channel with tons of screencasts:

	https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0lo9MOBetEFXG2IOr4As-8IZPOBYs3Jf

In particular, I would suggest looking at

	https://www.youtube.com/user/GitHubGuides

"Git Basics" and "GitHub Overview" are probably the most important for you.

Yep, that was not exactly what that page said, was it? It can be fixed,
but it requires more effort on your side than if you had not created the
files on the website.

Multiple errors, because you had to understand the commands listed in the
article in order to adapt them to your particular case.

For one, your repository is not called Hello-World.

Another problem is that you did not know how to undo an already-run
command (git remote add ...).

... and which you could use as described on

	https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-repositories#cloning

to clone your own GitHub repository.

GitHub for Mac can help you do that, if you study the information conveyed in

	https://help.github.com/articles/making-changes

This page has the information which you need to learn in order to use
GitHub for Mac to "push" (which they call synchronize because it is more
convenient than the "push" concept of Git what they do: they have a
two-way synchronisation between the remote repository and the local one).

Of course it is best if you understand that these commands work *inside*
one working directory that has remote information.

Well, what do you expect if you remove the 'origin' remote in your home
directory, which is not the working directory of the repository you
initialized with "git init"?

I told you in an earlier mail that each local repository lives in a .git/
subdirectory of the working directory. You created a Hello-World directory
and made it the working directory of a newly-initialized repository by
calling

	git init

*inside* Hello-World/. So that is where your Git information is: in
Hello-World/.git/.

Git will not try to guess what you mean if you are outside that directory.

> ChrisGAIAG:~ chris$ git remote add origin https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards
> fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

In general, it is a real bad idea to call the second command in any set of
instructions when the first one failed.

> So do I need to cd to some place first?

Actually, yes. As described above, Git has no chance of knowing what
project you want it to work on if you are outside the project's working
directory.

It is even what Git said:

	fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

Which is true, because I am sure that there does not exist a .git/
directory in your home directory.

Well, I think that understanding the information given in

should help.

Oh, that is a new piece of information. I was left under the impression
that you built and ran the project inside NetBeans. Apparently not so.

So you *were* able to run your project in the meantime? I am sorry, but it
seems that I get incomplete information about the problems and the
progress on this side.

I fear that really, the only way forward that guarantees an efficient use
of your, Curtis' and my time, is to get familiar enough with Git or GitHub
for Mac so that you can publish exactly the files with which you have a
problem.

It is my failing that I do not understand from the descriptions what the
exact invocations and the exact error messages are, and therefore trying
to help you would only result in super-wild guesses that are unlikely to
assist you in fixing the issues.

The only way I could help effectively would be to be able to get at
exactly the same state where you are at, to be able to try to reproduce
your problem, and to fix it by way of a pull request (no need to fear, the
GitHub notification you receive will have detailed information that, when
read carefully, will equip you with everything you need to get back my
changes).

Ciao,
Johannes

Another, really brilliant resource is this:

	http://try.github.io

Make sure to read carefully the text above the pseudo-terminal. For
example, when they say

	Our terminal prompt below is currently in an octobox directory.

they mean that the current directory is called "octobox".  And when they
later say that

	I created a file called octocat.txt

that is important information to understand why the second "git status"
shows something different than the first.

I am certain that one interactive run-through with said page will help you
understand the principles, although I think they should have estimated 20
minutes for the little course, not 15.

Johannes

OK, thank you Johannes and Curtis.  So now you see I wasn't kidding when I said I was confused!  ;-)  Clearly I need to read and study a bit!  Believe it or not, your explanations are helping, and it is starting to come together for me -- before asking these questions I had no idea how to unravel this mystery, now I do!  Thanks again.

Message-ID: <CADN69ymvEH8-DTTQQM8qogsrNkuUTyimHYKsC9Jj1xBqzBszXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone (especially Josh),

Right now, the ImageJ team has a Jenkins server cluster at
jenkins.imagej.net that performs an increasingly broad array of tasks. Of
course it builds ImageJ, but also Fiji, SCIFIO, SciJava Common, many
repository mirrors and synchronizers, and more.

We also have a Maven repository (using Nexus) at maven.imagej.net that has
an increasingly broad array of artifacts beyond just ImageJ.

Since all of the Jenkins jobs and Maven artifacts fall under the SciJava
umbrella, I think it would make sense to rebrand these services as SciJava
rather than only ImageJ.

Do others agree? If so, we could point jenkins.scijava.org and
maven.scijava.org (for simplicity, maybe just *.scijava.org) at the
server's IP (144.92.48.145). If we did this, I would still keep the old
URLs working for backwards compatibility, of course.

Thanks,
Curtis

Hi Michael & Lee,

Sorry for the delay in reply; it's a long thread. :-/

Michael wrote:
> Would it be possible to add a flag that surpresses previews checkboxes
> during dialog building?

It's tricky because right now, each preview checkbox is an input parameter
to the command itself. But personally I don't like that approach. It is not
a "real" input to the command, but rather intended to be toggled during
input harvesting only. One option might be to label the visibility of those
parameters as ItemVisibility.INVISIBLE. Then we could add a flag somewhere
to hide INVISIBLE parameters, maybe.

But really, I am leaning toward a simpler solution: just remove the preview
checkboxes, in favor of ImageJ2 *always* doing a preview (and of course,
KNIP doesn't have to). And if the previews are too slow, we can optimize
the preview() method to address it, rather than having this hacky checkbox
like ImageJ1 does.

Lee wrote:

Yes, each button generally performs some action, which we should really
make sure are always exposed as standalone commands (see next paragraph).
We are going to add logic to make multiple sequential Button widgets render
as a single button bar in our UI layout. Won't affect you though, Lee,
since you do your own UI in Python.

Michael wrote:
> Why is the threshold  plugin an interactive command?

Let me explain the motivation here. Anything that extends
InteractiveCommand is not *intended* to be run in headless mode. Rather, it
is intended as a sort of "meta-command" that allows you to launch other
commands. It will be filled with callback methods when various inputs
change, which should, in a properly designed InteractiveCommand, trigger
real command executions that are more well-behaved from a headless
standpoint.

Anything that extends InteractiveCommand should *not* be flagged with
"headless = true" since it is not intended for that purpose.

So in the case of threshold, we need a "real" threshold command that has
sensible inputs and outputs. Then the command exposed in the ImageJ UI as
"threshold" is actually "Interactive Threshold" which fires off Threshold
executions.

This is not all fully in place, but it is the direction we are going. Sound
reasonable?

Lee wrote:
> For Threshold, I can see reasons for executing the callbacks for
> "auto", "apply" and "delete" in a headless context

The above would also address your comments here, Lee. The interactive
threshold command would not need to be exposed within CP because those
buttons would each have a corresponding standalone headless-friendly
command which *would* be exposed.

Michael wrote:
> is there a way to determine if a command is dynamic?

Other than the hacky instanceof test you are doing, nope. I agree we should
add API for it to ModuleInfo. Especially because it is possible for modules
to be dynamic without extending the DynamicCommand class...

Could you please file a ticket for it on the ImageJ Trac? I just made
ImageJ Trac accounts for you, Christian & Martin; you should have an
automated email about it. I know Trac is not ideal (GitHub Issues is nice)
but we have all our ImageJ tickets in Trac now, migrating everything would
be very involved, and I don't really want to start splitting between two
issue trackers. Someday we might move...

This is probably a good idea. However, I agree with Lee that in some cases
it may not be totally clear-cut [1]. You think splitting ij-commands into
two JAR files is sufficient? If so, care to send a list of plugins you feel
are *not* generally useful, and I can split them out?

> Will the package path of the plugins be stable after ImageJ2 1.0.0 was

Yes, when ImageJ 2.0.0 final is released. From then on, we will always
deprecate any necessary moves, to keep old code working. And of course will
also try not to do it at all unless deemed really important.

That said, I don't really like the current package prefix of
"imagej.core.*" for various "core plugins." It is confusing that we have
"ij-core" which is the core *library* and that code does *not* have prefix
"imagej.core", whereas we have "core plugins" which *do* have package
prefix "imagej.core". I would welcome a better idea!

Yes. The img-metadata branch [2] is relevant here as far as axis names go.

I was thinking for starters, we could simply create new (headless-friendly)
commands that narrow the view of a given dataset using the ImgLib2 Views
class. Then from an end user perspective, if you want to limit the
execution of the algorithm, you just run that command first. This fits in
well with KNIME's node concept, where the answer to any given problem is
usually to just insert another node for preprocessing or whatever.

Do you think more than that is needed?

I agree, but do not have time to work on it. Proposals and PRs very
welcome. It would probably make the most sense to base any work on the Axis
metadata design from the img-metadata branch of ImgLib.

This is something we should pursue further for beta9, which is intended to
focus on ROIs.

Michael wrote:

Yes. Strictly speaking, that is correct.

However, there is a new ImageJ "gateway" class in ij-app so that you can
still say "new ImageJ(...)". And actually from that object you will get
lots more functionality: you can query any built-in service with a
compile-safe method. See the ImageJ tutorials for details [3].

Michael wrote:
> How can we query the ImageJ version?

I apologize that it is somewhat convoluted now. First, the code:

    ImageJ ij = new ImageJ();
    App ijApp = ij.app().getApp(ImageJApp.NAME);
    String ijApp.getVersion();

This uses the AppService feature of SciJava Common. The rationale is that
you may have a single SciJava Context with multiple associated applications
such as ImageJ, SCIFIO and SciJava Common itself. And obviously they don't
all have the same version. So you first have to ask the AppService for your
application of interest, then query its version.

We actually spit out this sort of stuff for *all* available applications in
the SystemInformation command:
https://github.com/imagej/imagej/blob/imagej-2.0.0-beta-7/plugins/commands/src/main/java/imagej/core/commands/debug/SystemInformation.java#L84

There are all sorts of goodies you can query, many of which are extracted
from either associated Maven POMs or JAR manifests. :-)

With the migration to SciJava Common, the property changed to
"scijava.log.level" but it works the same way.

That is a bug, thanks for reporting. However, moving the module service
after the menu service will not work because MenuService needs
CommandService which needs ModuleService.

What's weird to me is, I am not sure why we don't see this bug when running
the end-user ImageJ application...

I have some service initialization changes pending on ImageJ's
startup-speed branch, which may affect this. So we should debug further
once that branch is merged. Please feel free to file a Trac ticket for it
and assign to me.

Michael wrote:
> Is there a defined service order?

The order is defined by two things:
1) If a service has an @Parameter dependency on another service, the
dependency gets initialized first.
2) Otherwise, the "priority" property of the @Plugin annotation is used to
order service initialization.

No problem, and again, sorry if the long delay reduces your momentum and/or
enthusiasm. If you have any more questions, please fire away!

	Commit.
Message-ID: <51CE46D6.2000608@acadiau.ca>

Just an observation, and you may already have been informed of this bug, so
delete this if necessary:

The June 27th commit of imagej.data.display.DefaultImageDisplay has a bug
in the method "display(final Object o)". It should be quite obvious what the bug
is if you compare this commit to the one on the 12th of June.

(Hint: NullPointerException on Line 228)

All the best and have a great day.
