<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I restart it and get the same message again. So basically the updater is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; never started.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This was a bug in the Updater (affecting both Fiji and ImageJ2) that has
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully been sorted now, thanks to Johannes's efforts. Please let us
</I>&gt;<i> know if not.
</I>
Hi,
OK, I will test this next week.

&gt;<i> Until we get the multiple channel updates working though, we are erring on
</I>&gt;<i> the side of caution with the update site, meaning you must explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> download the latest snapshot build ZIP file if you want to try it before
</I>&gt;<i> each beta release.
</I>
Right but my point was that the &quot;latest&quot; was not so latest as the files were 
older than the beta avaiable... and so it becomes a confusing issue.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; What is one supposed to do with the Combined build file (*-all.jar)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This combined &quot;uber-JAR&quot; is for developers only, as an option, to use with
</I>&gt;<i> external integration. For example, CellProfiler uses it, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> bundling each of the individual ImageJ2 JAR files. It is not intended for
</I>&gt;<i> use with the ImageJ application bundle.
</I>
I see, I also think that this needs explanation in that page.

&gt;<i> You said you got this sorted, so hopefully it was something easy. If you
</I>&gt;<i> had to do anything unintuitive, please let us know; it is supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;just work&quot; like ImageJ1 does.
</I>
I emailed Barry an example plugin where things do not work as expected (not 
sure if he received that).
The downloads page should perhaps be more explicit about the possibility of 
openjdk not working with the IJ2 beta (and Oracle's Java 1.7 has some problems 
too...).
For example opensuse ships with openjdk by default (and at least some old 
versions of Kubuntu did as well).

Cheeers
