<PRE>Hi Gabriel,

&gt;<i> &gt; This combined &quot;uber-JAR&quot; is for developers only, as an option
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see, I also think that this needs explanation in that page.
</I>
I started fleshing out the &quot;Combined build&quot; section of the Downloads page,
but then decided to simply remove it. Honestly, it is better for developers
*not* to use that JAR. It was only provided as a convenience for those who
strongly prefer it. Using a single combined JAR has many disadvantages
though, so I'd rather not advertise its existence on the Downloads page. We
will continue to have Jenkins build it though.

If we get to the point where there is enough demand for it that it should
really be explained on the web site, I will create a separate page for it
explaining the pros &amp; cons of using it, along with alternatives. But we'll
cross that bridge later.

&gt;<i> The downloads page should perhaps be more explicit about the possibility
</I>of
&gt;<i> openjdk not working with the IJ2 beta (and Oracle's Java 1.7 has some
</I>problems
&gt;<i> too...).
</I>
I added the following text to the Downloads page's &quot;System requirements&quot;
section:

&quot;Please note that we currently test ImageJ2 mostly with Oracle Java 6.
There may be additional bugs when using it with OpenJDK, as well as Oracle
Java 7. Feel free to report any such issues to the mailing list.&quot;

Regards,
Curtis

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I restart it and get the same message again. So basically the updater

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This was a bug in the Updater (affecting both Fiji and ImageJ2) that has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hopefully been sorted now, thanks to Johannes's efforts. Please let us
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know if not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I will test this next week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Until we get the multiple channel updates working though, we are erring
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the side of caution with the update site, meaning you must explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; download the latest snapshot build ZIP file if you want to try it before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each beta release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right but my point was that the &quot;latest&quot; was not so latest as the files
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> older than the beta avaiable... and so it becomes a confusing issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What is one supposed to do with the Combined build file (*-all.jar)?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This combined &quot;uber-JAR&quot; is for developers only, as an option, to use
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; external integration. For example, CellProfiler uses it, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bundling each of the individual ImageJ2 JAR files. It is not intended for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use with the ImageJ application bundle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see, I also think that this needs explanation in that page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You said you got this sorted, so hopefully it was something easy. If you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; had to do anything unintuitive, please let us know; it is supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;just work&quot; like ImageJ1 does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I emailed Barry an example plugin where things do not work as expected (not
</I>&gt;<i> sure if he received that).
</I>&gt;<i> The downloads page should perhaps be more explicit about the possibility of
</I>&gt;<i> openjdk not working with the IJ2 beta (and Oracle's Java 1.7 has some
</I>&gt;<i> problems
</I>&gt;<i> too...).
</I>&gt;<i> For example opensuse ships with openjdk by default (and at least some old
</I>&gt;<i> versions of Kubuntu did as well).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheeers
