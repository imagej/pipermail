I fear that the way I implemented the initialization of the UploadService
(it is done on *any* startup of the Updater, not just when an Uploader is
needed), we may run into trouble.

Having said that, the Fiji-Updater.jar I uploaded earlier this week should
remedy the problem by simply falling back to the Updater as uploaded this
past Monday, until a current and working Updater is available locally.

I will test with a setup as it would be when you updated two weeks ago but
not after that, but my guess is that we should maybe wait with *uploading*
a new Updater a couple of days.

Unfortunately, this would interfere with uploading beta4, right? Let's
discuss after my tests...

Ciao,
Dscho
