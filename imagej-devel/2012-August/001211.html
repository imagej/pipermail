After testing a couple of times with different levels of &quot;up-to-dateness&quot;,
it seems as if my recent work to make the Updater more robust really paid
off: there is no problem running the updater. I just need to make sure to
upload a complete IJ2 (and remove the files that were renamed/made
obsolete) so that the Fiji Updater does not *always* fall back to the
hard-coded remote updater (which would be the version from this past
Monday).

So: full steam ahead, I'll merge service-parameters after lunch and take
care of uploading stuff.

Ciao,
Dscho
