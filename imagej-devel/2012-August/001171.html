The past weeks I worked hard on the updater, so we will probably have
those &quot;nightlies&quot; as an update site. They might not even be &quot;nightlies&quot;
but uploaded whenever there is a change in the source code repository that
has been verified by Jenkins as compiling and passing the regression
tests.

Having said that, please don't hold your breath for it... there are other
projects I need to take care of, projects which had to wait for me to
finalize the current state of the updater.

Ciao,
Dscho
