<PRE>Hi Johannes,

thanks for the suggestions.

 &gt;&gt; 'mvn install' stops with
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; [ERROR] The goal you specified requires a project to execute but 
there is no
 &gt;&gt; POM in this directory.
 &gt;
 &gt; I am an idiot! Avian uses the &quot;make&quot; command. That will compile things
 &gt; into a subdirectory of build/. It actually requires JAVA_HOME to point to
 &gt; a JDK and javac to be in the PATH. Sorry for not describing this
 &gt; correctly.
 &gt;

OK, I tried make, but the makefile doesn't support Visual Studio (only 
on Windows Phone, not on Windows 7). So I guess I'll have to start over 
on a Linux box, because a mingw build will most certainly be 
incompatible with the maven-compiled stuff, which used Visual Studio. 
And anyway, mingw64 isn't supported either, only mingw32. cmake is not 
that bad, after all...

 &gt;&gt;&gt;     'wip' of <A HREF="https://github.com/dscho/vigra-imglib2">https://github.com/dscho/vigra-imglib2</A>
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; 'mvn install' stops with
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; [ERROR] Error: Class net.imglib2.Interval could not be found.
 &gt;
 &gt; That is funny. It works here without a hitch, but maybe only because 
I had
 &gt; cloned and &quot;mvn install&quot;ed <A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imglib">https://github.com/imagej/imglib</A> earlier. Will
 &gt; investigate.
 &gt;

When Tobias tried his code on my machine, we had a similar problem. We 
solved it by adding some paths explicitly (vigra-imglib2/target/classes 
and 
$HOME/.m2/repository/net/imglib2/imglib2/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/imglib2-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar). 
I applied the same change to your pom file, and got a bit further. The 
error message is now

[ERROR] Error: Could not find class file for 
'net.imglib2.vigra.VigraImg3DUnsignedByte'.

 &gt;&gt; BTW, Tobias' VIGRA bindings work on my machine (Windows 7 with Visual
 &gt;&gt; Sudio 2012).
 &gt;
 &gt; Okay. I fear that he duplicated a large part of my work to get there, but
 &gt; then, I cannot look at it anyway
 &gt;

No, there is no duplication. The two approaches are completely 
complementary -- yours is for embedding Java in a VIGRA program, and 
Tobias' is to call VIGRA code from Java. You can have a look at

Best regards
