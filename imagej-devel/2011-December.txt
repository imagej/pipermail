Hi all,

I just thought it might of interest for some people here. The Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Generics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden will focus more on Computational & Systems Biology in the future. The application deadline for the upcoming PhD selection is the 6th of January, you can have a look at the poster if you are interested:

All the best,
Stephan

Hi everyone,

The ImageJ2 web resources have been migrated to the *imagej.net* domain:

   - *imagejdev.org* has become *developer.imagej.net*
   - *dev.imagejdev.org* has become *code.imagej.net*
   - Later in 2012, the toplevel site *imagej.net* will become the main
   portal into ImageJ topics

If you have an SVN checkout or Git clone of ImageJ2, you may want to update
your upstream URL, so that you can continue to pull changes from the
server; for details, see this blog post:

  http://developer.imagej.net/2011/12/16/domain-name-updates

Note that the mailing list address has changed as well; it is now *
imagej-devel at imagej.net*.

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Michael,

Apologies, that page had not been updated in a while. I have now updated
the links.

In particular, you can find the Javadoc at:
  http://code.imagej.net:8080/job/ImgLib-daily/javadoc/

Note that the page includes Javadoc for both ImgLib1 (package prefix
mpicbg.imglib) and ImgLib2 (package prefix net.imglib2).

What I really want though, is Javadoc and source for my plugin build

The mega-jar now includes all ImageJ2 source code. It is linked from the
Downloads page at:
  http://developer.imagej.net/downloads

Note that it has been renamed to "imagej-2.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar" for clarity
("ij-app" was a bad name).

For now, the ImgLib2 source code is not included; adding that is more
complicated so I will work on it later.

Please let us know how it works for you!

Regards,
Curtis
