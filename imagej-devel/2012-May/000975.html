<PRE>Hi everyone,

In keeping with the fine tradition of making a release on Friday afternoon,
and immediately going on vacation, the ImageJDev team is pleased to release
the second beta of ImageJ2, version 2.0.0-beta2!

ImageJ 2.0.0-beta2 is a &quot;beta&quot;-quality release, meaning the code is not
finished. The design is more stable than before but still subject to change
until the final 2.0.0 release. It is recommended that people continue to
use ImageJ v1.x for critical work.

The ImageJ2 user interface is modeled after ImageJ v1.x as much as
possible. However, under the hood, ImageJ2 is a complete redesign of
ImageJ. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ by
bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between &quot;legacy&quot; and &quot;modern&quot;
image structures.

The beta still has many bugs and limitations, but we have made some
progress: ImageJ2 now has better support for headless image displays, and
some critical bugs were also fixed. In particular, it should now work on
Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.

Many legacy ImageJ plugins and macros work; many others do not. There are
still many bugs. In particular, there are a few issues specifically
regarding 2.0.0-beta2:

- On Windows &amp; Linux, you must have Java already installed; ImageJ2 is not
bundled with Java, nor will it download it for you.
- Also on Windows &amp; Linux, the menu bar is sometimes unresponsive.
- Image windows do not always pack correctly, resulting in scroll bars.
- Using a drawing tool on a panned or zoomed image does not draw in the
right place.
- Zooming does not follow the mouse cursor properly.

We are hoping to fix most of the above issues for the next beta.

For further details on this release, including a discussion of new
features, please see our blog post:
