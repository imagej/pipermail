Software developer post at the Imagopole facilities of the Institut Pasteur Paris

The Imagopole (www.imagopole.org) is a large multi-disciplinary centre for functional analyses of biological systems using optical and electron microscope imaging methods. It serves primarily researchers working on infection, microbiology and immunology at the Institut Pasteur Paris, but is also open at national and international levels for external research needs. With around fifty associate research and engineering staff, rendering advanced technologies for life sciences research to over five hundred users, we have special need for excellence in imaging informatics, and currently are seeking a an experienced software developer to join our team, for an appointment of three years. Specifically, the candidate will join the Imagopole in the context of a newly funded program (Wellcome Trust London) aimed to develop OME/OMERO (OME) image database architecture in the context of an international consortium of partners led by Pr. Jason Swedlow (Dundee University, UK), and including the Institut Pasteur Paris. The appointee will drive local development of a campus scale OME database supporting Imagopole users from Pasteur. The successful candidate will be an experienced self-starter, integrated into a dynamic team environment, and will take inspiration forOME development from colleagues and users. There will be ample opportunity and encouragement to collaborate with other software developers, bioinformaticians and IT experts across the campus.

The Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) is in an exciting, well-funded initiative aiming to leverage great functionality for image db management through a community effort for improved and updated Bio-Formats; integration with ImageJ2, CellProfiler, and KNIME. Downstream there are plans for improved support for heterogeneous data, probably via NoSQL; improved data model and ontology support; improved support for distributed compute for large-scale analysis. While OMERO applications are mostly written in Java and Python with some JavaScript and PL/pgSQL the foundations are old-school (PostgreSQL, ZeroC&#8217;s ICE mixed with a taste of web scale computing; NoSQL, HDF5 and PyTables). So, the candidate must have the technical skills to integrate to this professional team, and the independence to use their skills for local developments in the Institut Pasteur Imagopole.

The successful applicant will be based in Paris France, and will interact closely with researchers and software developers based in Scotland, Germany, Italy, and the USA. For more information, see <A HREF="http://openmicroscopy.org.">http://openmicroscopy.org.</A>
