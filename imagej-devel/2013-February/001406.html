Hi everybody,
Just to clarify, I did let Antti know that I was intending to port some of his 
Matlab code into Java for ImageJ and that was releases (as in his code) as 
GPL. Original exchange follows below.

You may want to contact Emre Celebi &lt;<A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-devel">emrecelebi1980 at gmail.com</A>&gt;
about some other methods included in the code. He was aware that I was 
implementing some of his methods from the the Fourier package (in sourceforge) 
in Java.

Cheers
Gabriel

Hello Gabriel,

It's great to hear that you are finding my little thresholding toolbox 
useful.

Are you sure that the cameraman image is exactly the same one as the one 
that I used? Mine is the one that came with MATLAB. Subtle differences in 
pixel values (that do not even affect what the image looks like) might 
affect the threshold that you get.

The modes that I get are 13 and 165, so yours are off by one. Could it be 
an indexing problem? That just crossed my mind since indexing starts from 
zero in Java (if I'm not mistaken).

Also, the convolution on line 38 of th_intermodes.m might be something 
that you implemented differently. The line is y = conv2(y,h,'same'); Since 
I use the option 'same', the output y is the samze size as the input y. 
Therefore, how the input y is padded has an effect on the output. MATLAB 
uses zero padding, so if you used some other padding, the threshold might 
end up being different.

Good luck!

Sincerely,
Antti Niemist&#246;
