Dual licensing would be perfectly acceptable.

Thank you for the links.

However, we would like to use the algorithms in ImageJ2 (written in Java):
<A HREF="http://developer.imagej.net/">http://developer.imagej.net/</A> (and <A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imagej">https://github.com/imagej/imagej</A>).

In another mail thread (which I would merge with this one if I had more
time), we asked Gabriel Landini (who would have been Cc:ed if this mail
was in the same thread), who transformed your code into a GPLed
ImageJ plugin, whether he would be willing to relicense the code so we
would not have to rewrite it:

<A HREF="http://imagej.net/pipermail/imagej-devel/2013-February/001390.html">http://imagej.net/pipermail/imagej-devel/2013-February/001390.html</A>

It was only after his positive answer that we realized that part of the
code was derived from your GPLed code and we would require your
willingness to relicense to use the transformed code.

Thanks,
Dscho
