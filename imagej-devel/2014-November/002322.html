<PRE>Hi Tobias,

&gt;<i>What would be nice would be some kind of notification when new pom parents
</I>are released.

<A HREF="http://status.imagej.net/">http://status.imagej.net/</A> reports latest component versions... I actually
thought it reported latest pom, but just realized it does not! We will be
splitting this page by org so it's a bit more readable (e.g.
status.imagej.net/fiji) so that will be a good time to also post the pom
versions.

Further I am working on fleshing out the scijava-maven-plugin
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/scijava/scijava-maven-plugin">https://github.com/scijava/scijava-maven-plugin</A>&gt;, to provide more tooling
to ease the management burden of our projects. Curtis and I just talked
about having a &quot;mvn scijava:report&quot; type command that will print out the
pom hierarchy of your current project, and show the version properties
provided by each pom. I'd like to make this tooling also report latest
available versions, and then integrate it into status.imagej.net generation.

Also, you can react to pretty much anything via GitHub's webhook API
&lt;<A HREF="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">https://developer.github.com/webhooks/</A>&gt;. We currently report activity to
IRC - so there should be records of releases in the chat logs. Having a
nice subscription list for when a new release comes out seems very
plausible, but I couldn't find anything premade with some brief googling.

Best,
Mark

</I>&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a question for anyone consuming the pom-* parents of the SciJava
</I>&gt;<i> software stack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We want to start versioning these POM parents according to consistent
</I>&gt;<i> rules. (Unfortunately, right now, the approach is vague and potentially
</I>&gt;<i> inconsistent [1].) We came up with the following two possible schemes, and
</I>&gt;<i> would like your feedback on which one you would prefer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> == 1) SemVer ==
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every POM parent has three digits, X.Y.Z.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The X digit is &quot;major&quot; and when incremented indicates a breaking change of
</I>&gt;<i> some sort: either A) plugin config changes requiring downstream changes, or
</I>&gt;<i> more commonly B) major SemVer dependency version bumps (e.g., managed
</I>&gt;<i> scijava-common version updated from 2.35.0 to 3.0.0). This would exclude
</I>&gt;<i> 0.x and beta components though (so e.g. imglib2-realtransform could go from
</I>&gt;<i> 2.0.0-beta-27 to 2.0.0-beta-28 without bumping pom-imglib2's X digit).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Y digit is &quot;minor&quot; and incremented when dependency versions change in
</I>&gt;<i> a SemVer-compatible manner, or when plugin configuration is added or
</I>&gt;<i> improved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For critical bug-fixes where a given POM parent is somehow compromised or
</I>&gt;<i> broken, the third digit Z can be bumped before going to the next Y. (See
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. the recent pom-fiji 5.0.Z series of releases.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> == 2) Bread crumb version trail ==
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The pom-scijava parent would have a single version digit. The pom-imagej
</I>&gt;<i> (which is the next POM down) would have two: the first in lockstep with its
</I>&gt;<i> pom-scijava parent, and the second being its dedicated version digit. POMs
</I>&gt;<i> which extend pom-imagej (i.e.: pom-scifio, pom-imglib2 and pom-fiji) would
</I>&gt;<i> have three digits: the first two in lockstep with pom-imagej and the third
</I>&gt;<i> their own. And so on down the line&#8212;e.g., pom-trakem2 would need four
</I>&gt;<i> digits: the first three matching the pom-fiji parent and the fourth its own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> == Pros and cons ==
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Option 1:
</I>&gt;<i> [PRO] Semantic meaning. You can reason whether a given POM is somehow
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;breaking&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> [PRO] Succinctness. Every parent POM has at most three digits at any one
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;<i> [CON] Lack of provenance. Not obvious which parent POMs go together
</I>&gt;<i> without leaning on a tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Option 2:
</I>&gt;<i> [PRO] Clear provenance. You can trivially derive the chain of parent POM
</I>&gt;<i> versions.
</I>&gt;<i> [CON] Lack of semantics. Harder to tell which POM parent releases might
</I>&gt;<i> break backwards compatibility.
</I>&gt;<i> [CON] Aesthetics. More than 3 digits in a version string may not be
</I>&gt;<i> desirable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that either way, we are in the process of creating a
</I>&gt;<i> scijava-maven-plugin goal to dump all the component version properties
</I>&gt;<i> associated with a given parent POM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since either scheme is consistent and useful, we want to institute
</I>&gt;<i> whichever scheme will annoy everyone less. ;-) So which do people like
</I>&gt;<i> better: SemVer or breadcrumbs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Curtis
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [1] The 5.x POM versioning approach was an attempt to achieve _both_
</I>&gt;<i> options above, but Mark &amp; I realized today that the two goals are rather
</I>&gt;<i> mutually exclusive. That is, we cannot keep POM parent versions fully in
</I>&gt;<i> lockstep while also maintaining a SemVer versioning scheme.
