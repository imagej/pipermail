<PRE>For CelllProfiler, there's some packaging work that would need to be done
(we bundle the JRE with the Windows version and the Centos 6 RPM has Java 6
as a dependency). We rely on the system Java for the Mac presently and I
don't have a clear idea of what range of Java 7 support to expect on our
user's Macs.

It certainly seems like there is a lot of pressure to move to Java 7, so my
vote would be to move to Java 7, even considering the above.

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> what is everyones opinion on moving the IJ2/Fiji stack to a new version of
</I>&gt;<i> Java, i.e., Java 7.
</I>&gt;<i> Java 7 has been around for more than 3 years now. The end-of-life final
</I>&gt;<i> public release of Java 6 was more than 1.5 years ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Benefits I see are the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * We could use the &#8220;new&quot; Java 7 libraries. For example the Fork/Join
</I>&gt;<i> framework would come handy in defining multi-threading interfaces in
</I>&gt;<i> scijava-common (to be used in imagej-ops for example). Or the NIO2 stuff
</I>&gt;<i> (java.nio.file)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * We would benefit from improvements of type inference for generics in the
</I>&gt;<i> compiler. No more jumping through hoops to fix &#8220;errors&#8221; in code that should
</I>&gt;<i> compile with Java 6 but doesn&#8217;t. (Plus we could use the diamond operator to
</I>&gt;<i> shorten generics instantiations.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * We could use third-party libraries that only support Java 7. For example
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m using Jetty in a project that can therefore not be part of Fiji
</I>&gt;<i> currently. (This mail was more or less triggered by me looking into
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ojalgo.org">http://ojalgo.org</A> who maybe went a bit over the top and already abandoned
</I>&gt;<i> Java 7 for Java 8). I think it is only a matter of time until we will have
</I>&gt;<i> a problem with third-party libraries that we already use abandoning Java 6.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not have a clear picture of what the downsides would be. Johannes
</I>&gt;<i> always said that people on old macs are tied to an old java version and
</I>&gt;<i> that we do not want to leave those users behind. It would be interesting to
</I>&gt;<i> know how many people that actually would impact.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Tobias
