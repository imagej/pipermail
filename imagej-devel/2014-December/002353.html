<PRE>Hi,

we are considering to increase the required Java version for ImageJ2/Fiji from 6 to 7.
Java 6 has been unsupported (ie, no more fixes and updates) for over 1.5 years now, Java 7 is around for a long time, and developers are moving on to Java 8 even.

Before we just move to Java 7, we want to see what users would think about this. So, are there any strong opinions out there?

best regards,
Tobias

</I>&gt;<i> Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;When replying to a post like this, is it the done thing to reply to the list in general or should I be replying just to the original poster?
</I>&gt;<i> You did the right thing - reply to the whole list. That way there is a complete record of any discussion-especially important on a general topic like this. Personally, if I ever get a private mail in response to something, I cc the list in my reply (see also: <A HREF="http://imagej.net/Philosophy#Open_source">http://imagej.net/Philosophy#Open_source</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Out of curiosity, how do people feel about establishing set guidelines for when to advance Java versions (e.g. if it's 18 months past the end-of-life release and under 2% of the users would be affected, just upgrade)? There will certainly be times when this question will come up again... and my only hesitation towards agreeing with consensus here is that these particular mailing lists seem likely to be biased towards active developers (who I would expect to prefer newer Java versions).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Mark
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. Thanks for starting this thread Tobias!

</I>&gt;<i> For CelllProfiler, there's some packaging work that would need to be done (we bundle the JRE with the Windows version and the Centos 6 RPM has Java 6 as a dependency). We rely on the system Java for the Mac presently and I don't have a clear idea of what range of Java 7 support to expect on our user's Macs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It certainly seems like there is a lot of pressure to move to Java 7, so my vote would be to move to Java 7, even considering the above.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> what is everyones opinion on moving the IJ2/Fiji stack to a new version of Java, i.e., Java 7.
</I>&gt;<i> Java 7 has been around for more than 3 years now. The end-of-life final public release of Java 6 was more than 1.5 years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Benefits I see are the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * We could use the &#8220;new&quot; Java 7 libraries. For example the Fork/Join framework would come handy in defining multi-threading interfaces in scijava-common (to be used in imagej-ops for example). Or the NIO2 stuff (java.nio.file)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * We would benefit from improvements of type inference for generics in the compiler. No more jumping through hoops to fix &#8220;errors&#8221; in code that should compile with Java 6 but doesn&#8217;t. (Plus we could use the diamond operator to shorten generics instantiations.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * We could use third-party libraries that only support Java 7. For example I&#8217;m using Jetty in a project that can therefore not be part of Fiji currently. (This mail was more or less triggered by me looking into <A HREF="http://ojalgo.org">http://ojalgo.org</A> who maybe went a bit over the top and already abandoned Java 7 for Java 8). I think it is only a matter of time until we will have a problem with third-party libraries that we already use abandoning Java 6.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not have a clear picture of what the downsides would be. Johannes always said that people on old macs are tied to an old java version and that we do not want to leave those users behind. It would be interesting to know how many people that actually would impact.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Tobias
