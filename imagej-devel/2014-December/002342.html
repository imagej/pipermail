<PRE>Jay,
&gt;<i>Can anyone else confirm this experience?
</I>Yep, Yosemite dropped Java 6. Definitely an annoying extra barrier for
developers. But there's a FAQ entry
&lt;<A HREF="http://imagej.net/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_set_up_Java_6_on_OS_X.3F">http://imagej.net/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_set_up_Java_6_on_OS_X.3F</A>&gt;
now!

Michael,
&gt;<i>When replying to a post like this, is it the done thing to reply to the
</I>list in general or should I be replying just to the original poster?
You did the right thing - reply to the whole list. That way there is a
complete record of any discussion-especially important on a general topic
like this. Personally, if I ever get a private mail in response to
something, I cc the list in my reply (see also:
<A HREF="http://imagej.net/Philosophy#Open_source">http://imagej.net/Philosophy#Open_source</A>)

Out of curiosity, how do people feel about establishing set guidelines for
when to advance Java versions (e.g. if it's 18 months past the end-of-life
release and under 2% of the users would be affected, just upgrade)? There
will certainly be times when this question will come up again... and my
only hesitation towards agreeing with consensus here is that these
particular mailing lists seem likely to be biased towards active developers
(who I would expect to prefer newer Java versions).

Best,
Mark

P.S. Thanks for starting this thread Tobias!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what is everyones opinion on moving the IJ2/Fiji stack to a new version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of Java, i.e., Java 7.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Java 7 has been around for more than 3 years now. The end-of-life final
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public release of Java 6 was more than 1.5 years ago.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Benefits I see are the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * We could use the &#8220;new&quot; Java 7 libraries. For example the Fork/Join
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> framework would come handy in defining multi-threading interfaces in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scijava-common (to be used in imagej-ops for example). Or the NIO2 stuff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (java.nio.file)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * We would benefit from improvements of type inference for generics in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the compiler. No more jumping through hoops to fix &#8220;errors&#8221; in code that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should compile with Java 6 but doesn&#8217;t. (Plus we could use the diamond
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> operator to shorten generics instantiations.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * We could use third-party libraries that only support Java 7. For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example I&#8217;m using Jetty in a project that can therefore not be part of Fiji
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently. (This mail was more or less triggered by me looking into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ojalgo.org">http://ojalgo.org</A> who maybe went a bit over the top and already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abandoned Java 7 for Java 8). I think it is only a matter of time until we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will have a problem with third-party libraries that we already use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abandoning Java 6.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do not have a clear picture of what the downsides would be. Johannes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> always said that people on old macs are tied to an old java version and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we do not want to leave those users behind. It would be interesting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know how many people that actually would impact.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> best regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Tobias
