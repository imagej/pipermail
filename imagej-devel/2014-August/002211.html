<PRE>Hi Tobias,

&gt;<i> I imagine that in many cases it would be helpful to somehow produce an
</I>&gt;<i> explicit list of transitive (runtime) dependencies at compile time.
</I>&gt;<i> But this is probably not possible because these dependencies are
</I>&gt;<i> specified as interfaces and there is no way of knowing beforehand the
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies of the implementing class that will be used at runtime.
</I>
Actually, you can do it either way. If you ask for an interface, it adds
all concrete service plugins that implement that interface. If you ask for
a concrete class, you get that concrete class only. But it is true that
whenever you ask for an interface, you will also transitively bring in all
dependencies of all implementing classes.

&gt;<i> In the present case it is even worse, because, if I understand
</I>&gt;<i> correctly, simply put the problem was not a missing dependency is
</I>&gt;<i> missing but additional stuff being present?
</I>
Right. There was an additional AppEventService that had a dependency on the
most problematic and limited ImageJ service: the DefaultLegacyService.

Another way I plan to (eventually!) mitigate that is to make the
DefaultLegacyService less crabby: I want it to be possible to have more
than one, that simply ends up referencing the same instance of ImageJ 1.x.
This shouldn't be too hard to do but haven't had to time explore that yet.
This would &quot;paper over&quot; the problem you had in that you wouldn't have
received an exception, but still would have brought in a whole bunch of
unneeded service dependencies for the purposes of ImgOpener.

The real fix here is to retool the AppEvent API as described here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/commit/852f05cf1dbfb3ce99ccd416fee64573a0692764">https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/commit/852f05cf1dbfb3ce99ccd416fee64573a0692764</A>

This is a critical bug in SJC which I will work on resolving today if
possible.

Regards,
Curtis

</I>&gt;<i> I agree that this is a two-edged sword. We have more types of plugins now,

</I>&gt;<i> This is already true in ImageJ 1.x though, because it is extensible at

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, it would not be worth it to eliminate these powerful extension points
</I>&gt;<i> just because of this possibility. The flexibility gained outweighs any
</I>&gt;<i> disadvantages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that it is very powerful and I&#8217;m not proposing to eliminate it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m happy that my problem is just a quirk and that I will be able to
</I>&gt;<i> continue just calling new ImgOpener(), in blissfull ignorance of what is
</I>&gt;<i> going on behind the scenes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have already taken great pains to mitigate the issue with services in
</I>&gt;<i> the context: when you create a new ImgOpener without specifying an SJC
</I>&gt;<i> context, it uses _only_ relevant service types: things that implement the
</I>&gt;<i> SciJavaService and SCIFIOService interfaces. In other words: _not_
</I>&gt;<i> ImageJServices or other service types. The reason LegacyService is being
</I>&gt;<i> (erroneously!) pulled in here is due to a bug in the design of the SJC
</I>&gt;<i> AppEventService, as I said. I introduced a &quot;LegacyAppEventService&quot; which is
</I>&gt;<i> a SciJavaService but depends on the ImageJ LegacyService. Hence, any
</I>&gt;<i> Context that asks for SciJavaServices now pulls in a DefaultLegacyService
</I>&gt;<i> whenever the LegacyAppEventService is on the classpath. The fix is to stop
</I>&gt;<i> doing that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, if it still bothers you that any ol' developer can add something
</I>&gt;<i> to the classpath which hoses up your programs, then you can stop it: create
</I>&gt;<i> a more carefully controlled SJC Context and pass that to the ImgOpener.
</I>&gt;<i> Alternately, we could change ImgOpener to be even more conservative in
</I>&gt;<i> which services it uses. Of course, there are downsides there: any
</I>&gt;<i> additional file format plugins, codec plugins, etc., might not be work
</I>&gt;<i> properly if they do not have access to the services they need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am very open to ideas for mitigating the extensibility issues here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I currently have only limited knowledge of the workings of scijava-common
