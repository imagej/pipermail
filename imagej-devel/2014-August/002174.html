<PRE>Hi Vera,

</I>
Yes, the idea of ImageJ2 is to future-proof ImageJ for many more use
cases, including writing a new application.

For details, see <A HREF="http://imagej.net/ImageJ2#Features_of_ImageJ2">http://imagej.net/ImageJ2#Features_of_ImageJ2</A>

&gt;<i> What I would like to use it is:
</I>&gt;<i> - reading, writing, accessing pixel values of multidimensional
</I>&gt;<i> (multispectral) images,
</I>&gt;<i> - FFT, histograms, using the Filters (as they are in the ImageJ app)
</I>&gt;<i> - Addition, multiplication etc. of image pixel values as they are in the
</I>&gt;<i> Image Calculator methods (add, divide, multiply...)
</I>
It sounds as if you would benefit from the modular structure of ImageJ2:
you can basically cherry-pick which parts you want to use. In particular,
it looks as if you could benefit from ImageJ OPS -- which is still in the
hot phase of development. To get an idea how to make use of ImageJ OPS,
please have a look here: <A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops">https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops</A> (scroll down
to the README)

&gt;<i> What I tried so far is using the .jars from the ImageJ.app and referenced
</I>&gt;<i> them as external libraries from my project. But on the very beginning when
</I>&gt;<i> I try creating the ImageJ object I keep receiving error messages related
</I>&gt;<i> to some of the Services, for example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Cannot instantiate more than one
</I>&gt;<i> DefaultLegacyService at net.imagej [...]
</I>
The problem you face is caused by *more* than one ImageJ object being
instantiated: every ImageJ object (which we call &quot;gateway&quot; because it is
basically a gateway to all the different services) is connected to a
&quot;SciJava context&quot; that basically offers all the services such as the
plugin service, the event service, the log service, etc

Due to limitations in ImageJ 1.x' design, the legacy service --
responsible for executing any function in ImageJ 1.x -- can be
instantiated only once per class loader. That means that you have to
*dispose* of a SciJava context offering a legacy service *before* you can
instantiate a new context.

&gt;<i> So I was wondering if I can use ImageJ2 as an image processing library
</I>&gt;<i> for my proejct...
</I>
Absolutely.

&gt;<i> If it is meant to be used as an image processing library which can be
</I>&gt;<i> referenced from other projects? If yes, could you send me some links I can
</I>&gt;<i> read how to properly set it up and reference the necessary libraries?
</I>
The best examples we have live in this source code repository:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imagej-tutorials/">https://github.com/imagej/imagej-tutorials/</A>

I would like to point you in particular to 'load-and-display-dataset' and
'using-ops'.

Ciao,
Johannes
