<PRE>Hi Tobias,

&gt;<i> Except now all dependencies are not there anymore because now there
</I>&gt;<i> are non-obvious (to me) implicit runtime dependencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I find this unfortunate.
</I>
I agree that this is a two-edged sword. We have more types of plugins now,
which can alter the runtime behavior in more ways, so of course it becomes
possible for ill-behaved plugins to bring down the system.

This is already true in ImageJ 1.x though, because it is extensible at
runtime: any plugin class could have a static initializer block that hoses
up the JVM however it can imagine. It is just easier to do now.

IMO, it would not be worth it to eliminate these powerful extension points
just because of this possibility. The flexibility gained outweighs any
disadvantages.

We have already taken great pains to mitigate the issue with services in
the context: when you create a new ImgOpener without specifying an SJC
context, it uses _only_ relevant service types: things that implement the
SciJavaService and SCIFIOService interfaces. In other words: _not_
ImageJServices or other service types. The reason LegacyService is being
(erroneously!) pulled in here is due to a bug in the design of the SJC
AppEventService, as I said. I introduced a &quot;LegacyAppEventService&quot; which is
a SciJavaService but depends on the ImageJ LegacyService. Hence, any
Context that asks for SciJavaServices now pulls in a DefaultLegacyService
whenever the LegacyAppEventService is on the classpath. The fix is to stop
doing that.

Anyway, if it still bothers you that any ol' developer can add something to
the classpath which hoses up your programs, then you can stop it: create a
more carefully controlled SJC Context and pass that to the ImgOpener.
Alternately, we could change ImgOpener to be even more conservative in
which services it uses. Of course, there are downsides there: any
additional file format plugins, codec plugins, etc., might not be work
properly if they do not have access to the services they need.

I am very open to ideas for mitigating the extensibility issues here.

Regards,
Curtis

</I>&gt;<i> Of course, you could also turn your plugin into an ImageJ2 plugin -- which
