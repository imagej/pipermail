Sounds good, I will be doing more work on the website content all next week,
and will probably enable some more modules as well. I will also update the
menu structure. I noticed that Grant filled in the "Funding" page -- thanks
for that. But please do not link the "About" tree to anything yet until I
have fleshed out the pages and filled in some missing information
(particularly on the "History" page). I will send another email when I have
something ready for everyone to proofread, and solicit comments from you all
before making it live.

I'm in the process of sending out a rash of emails today to stem the sudden
tide of questions and interest in all these ImageJ efforts. I'll probably CC
the imagej-devel list on several of those, so apologies in advance for the
spam. :-)

Hi again everyone,

I totally lied and added the About section as one of the main tabs, as well
as updating the front page. I did clean up the text a lot before doing it,
though. Feel free to give it a read and let me know if you want to add,
change or remove anything. Or you can log in yourself and make edits, though
if you make substantial edits it might be good to discuss them on this list
to reach a consensus.

Cheers,
Curtis

P. S. An email announcing the imagejdev.org project mission and goals to
interested parties is imminent. :-)

Hi everyone,

Most of you know me, but for those who don't, my name is Curtis Rueden of
the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI) at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. Together with Glencoe Software and the Open
Microscopy Environment (OME) consortium, LOCI releases the Bio-Formats
library for reading microscopy file formats. Many of you know this software
as a suite of ImageJ plugins which allow you to import pixels and metadata
in more than 70 formats into ImageJ.

Recently, together with the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) at Woods Hole
and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, LOCI submitted a successful
proposal to NIH to fund ImageJ development (for details, see
http://imagejdev.org/funding). We also have letters of support from both
Wayne Rasband and the Fiji development group (http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/) at
the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG).
The project is still in the early planning stage, but we have launched a
website (http://imagejdev.org/) describing the project aims, with we will
heavily expand upon in coming weeks.

As of now, the actively involved people include: Wayne Rasband of NIH;
Curtis Rueden of LOCI and Grant Harris of MBL as technical project leads;
Lee Kamentsky and Adam Fraser of Broad's CellProfiler project; an additional
3-4 LOCI full-time staff programmers being brought on board within the next
month; Fiji developers Albert Cardona, Johannes Schindelin and Stephan
Preibisch; and principal investigators Kevin Eliceiri (LOCI), Anne Carpenter
(Broad) and Rudolf Oldenbourg (MBL).

There has been a recent surge of interest in ImageJ and related projects:
ImageJ itself, Fiji/ImageJA, ImageJX, VisBio, TrakEM2, Endrov, and now of
course Imagejdev.org. There are also many other projects with at least some
interest in ImageJ as it evolves into the future: BioImageXD, CellProfiler,
FARSIGHT, Micro-Manager, OME, and many more. As such, I have CCed
participants in all of these projects, in the hope of maintaining an open
dialogue as the project moves forward. Please forward on to anyone else who
might be interested.

The mission of imagejdev.org is:
  * To lead ImageJ development with a clear vision.
  * To continue developing one official version of ImageJ to keep the user
community unified and happy.
  * To collaborate with other interested parties and institutions wherever
useful.
  * To ensure ImageJ remains useful and relevant to the broadest possible
community.
  * To maintain backwards compatibility with the current ImageJ as close to
100% as possible.
  * To avoid duplication of effort and instead leverage each others' work
wherever practical.
  * To provide a central online resource for ImageJ: program downloads, a
plugin repository, developer resources and more.

These goals will require careful planning and hard work to deliver, but will
be well worth the effort. There is great potential to use ImageJ as a
library, provide interoperability, or otherwise share code and ideas between
these efforts. Now is the time to guide ImageJ's future development.

For those interested in the technical goals, they are:

Aim I ? Improve the ImageJ core architecture
   a. Separate the data model from the user interface
      * Interface-driven, MVC design. Support AWT, Swing, headless/console,
etc. [see: http://imagejdev.org/plan]
      * Grant Harris has successfully refactored ImageJ's GUI into an
interface-centric design and replaced the AWT interface with Swing. [see:
http://imagejdev.org/files/imagejdev.org/ImageJX_Mar09.pdf]
      * Raymond Martin is also actively researching this issue. [see:
http://n2.nabble.com/ImageJ-development-involvement-contributions-td4102492.html
]
   b. Introduce an extensions framework for algorithms
      * Dimiter Prodanov proposed a revised PluginPlus interface on the
ImageJX mailing list that would serve as a reasonable starting point for
this aim, though there are many other questions and issues surrounding the
architecture of such an extensions framework. [see:
http://groups.google.com/group/imagejx/browse_thread/thread/3ac4cd10a7f1ec3c
]
   c. Broaden the image data model
      * Stephan Preibisch of Fiji has developed a Generic Image Processing
Library that could serve as a foundation for the broadened image data model.

Aim II ? Expand functionality by interfacing ImageJ with existing
open-source programs

Aim III ? Grow community-driven development while maintaining compatibility

For more details, you can read about the aims at: http://imagejdev.org/aims.
Soon, we will also post the accepted grant proposal in its entirety.

Over the next few days, Grant Harris and I will be responding to a number of
technical discussions that have cropped up on the ImageJ and ImageJX
development lists, as well as replying to a few private emails from some of
you as well. We apologize for the delay on these replies, but it has been a
very hectic time. Moving forward, you can expect many additions to the
imagejdev.org website and associated tools, and a solidifying development
plan as we meet with colleagues and discussion the best way forward for
these efforts.

In the meantime, please let us know if you have any questions or ideas for
collaboration!

Regards,
Curtis

Dear Curtis,

congratulations and thank you the exciting news! ImageJ needs a strategic development perspective and I will be happy to contribute my part if I can. For the technical goals, I think actually quite a few of us have been playing with (and partially implemented) new image and processing models, GUIs, plugin concepts etc. that never made it into the public. So there may be other interesting ideas out there that are relevant to this project but we have not heard about. Maintaining backward compatibility and smoothing the transition I see as the most difficult challenges though, which really need a good plan from the beginning. Thanks again and please keep us updated!

All the best,

Wilhelm

Dear Curtis,

Congratulations! I will be happy to contribute as well. It will be
good if we take our time and agree about some basic strategy about the
development of ImageJ.
I think, that other parties can contribute as well, notably the ones
who supported the first 2 COST applications:
- the Tudor group with whom collaborate from time to time
- Jerome Mutterer
- Kai Uwe Barthel


best regards,

Dimiter

Dear Curtis,

Thats wonderful news!

I'm, very much looking forward to working with you guys and other  
interested parties
on the future of ImageJ.

Of course, the Fiji project has ImageJ at its core (as Ubuntu has  
linux at its core)
so we are very happy to hear this news!

Also,
the next major version of BioImageXD will be in built using Java,
and be properly modular with separated GUI, algorithms and data,
so there is good chance for interoperability.

The mission goals are all laudable,
and its great that we are mostly all pushing in the same directions.

Here is chance to rebuild the ImageJ dev community in a productive and  
collaborative way.

Congratulations!

Dan

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] IjX source code
Message-ID: <857a86450912151403k3bb9c87dh9f9aca8adaa351ab@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Grant and I committed an initial version of his IjX refactoring, based on
ImageJ 1.42a.

You can access it from the imagejdev git repository:

The repository is enabled for read-only public access:
  git clone git://imagejdev.org/imagej.git

Or read/write access (once your SSH public key is registered):
  git clone git at imagejdev.org:imagej.git

(If you want commit access to the repository, send me an SSH public key, and
I'll add you.)

Or if you would rather just download the code as an archive for the moment:
  http://imagejdev.org/files/software/misc/IjX-12-15-09.zip

The AWT version is currently functional, but Grant is still tweaking the
Swing version, specifically java.awt.MenuBar vs. javax.swing.JMenuBar and
related issues. We will follow up again within a few days with an update on
that.

Regards,
Curtis
