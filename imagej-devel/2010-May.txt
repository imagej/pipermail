Hi everyone,

We pushed back the ROI meeting for two weeks to give us (mostly me) more
time to prepare. I still owe you all an email with a summary regarding ROIs,
known use cases, currently available resources, etc. I will try to send that
out early next week, to give people at least a few days to review the
material before the meeting on May 18th.

Here is the updated schedule for ImageJDev meetings through the end of May.

Tuesdays, 10-11am CDT, Rm 274 ? group planning sessions for fleshing out the
project's technical directions.

Thursdays, 3:30-4:30pm CDT, Rm 236 ? rotating informal status reports. Each
week, one of us will present recent work and discuss any open questions.

The tentative schedule is as follows:
Thu 6 May, 3:30pm - Aivar: progress on spectral lifetime work
Tue 11 May, 10am - NO MEETING
Thu 13 Apr, 3:30pm - Barry: progress on ImageJ unit testing
Tue 18 May, 10am - Discuss ROIs: java.awt.geom, JHotDraw, OME-XML
Thu 20 Apr, 3:30pm - TBD
Tue 25 May, 10am - Discuss scripting & plugins: Java 6 Scripting Framework
Thu 27 Apr, 3:30pm - TBD

Hello All,

Due to a unexpected change in my schedule, we are going to push back today's meeting to next week. So there will be no presentation today. Aivar will present next Thurday (the 13th) and Barry on the 20th. At the meeting on the 13th I will also discuss the plans for the LOCI remodel that will start on the 21st. 

I will be out tomorrow through Monday at a meeting but will be in email contact.  

best,
kevin

Hi all, hi Grant,

I have a question related to ROIs (again), following a question I sent  
earlier about ROI designs.

I guess that on Grant's design, the ROI objects will belong to the  
Viewer object: a Viewer has a ROI.

I was wondering how to handle the different kind of Viewers. Let us  
consider 2 viewers that can display only 3D data.
The first one would display it slice by slice, as existing ImageJ  
stack. The second one would make a 3D rendering, line Bene Schmidt 3D  
viewer.

Let us now consider a 3D ROI, in the shape of a cube.

To be drawn on the first viewer, the slice viewer, the ROI needs to  
have a method that specifies what is the currently displayed slice to  
be properly drawn, something like:

@Override
public abstract void draw(final int current_slice);

On the other hand, the second viewer does not require this, since the  
ROI will be drawn at once. This gives a draw method in the ROI which  
is like:

@Override
public abstract  void draw();

How do we deal with that in the mother interface? How do we deal with  
the fact that different viewers might have different requirements for  
drawing objects (images or ROI) and how do we make a mother interface  
for ROIs, and a mother interface for Viewer?

Best
jy

I'm slightly removed from this discussion about ROIs, so take this with a
grain of salt.  What makes sense to me would to to have the ROI to return
the data in the cube, then it'd be the viewer's job to subset that further
(possibly by using a second ROI) and display it.

Am I making sense? Stop me if I'm misunderstanding the ROI spec.

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] CellProfiler / ImageJ
Message-ID: <4BED6DBF.6040308@broadinstitute.org>

Sneak preview: I've created an ImageJ module (RunImageJ) in 
CellProfiler; because of AWT issues, it only works in Windows for now. 
It's in the code-base if you're hardcore, for the curious with access to 
a PC, you can get an MSI install from http://www.broadinstitute.org/~leek

To see it in its full chimeral glory, put the RunImageJ module in your 
pipeline (it's in the Image Processing module group) and press the 
"Show" button at the bottom of the module settings panel. For now, it 
works by optionally injecting a single image into ImageJ's current 
ImagePlus object, running a macro or command and then harvesting the 
current ImagePlus object. I am guessing that a clever macro writer might 
operate on multiple images with several RunImageJ modules which each 
inject an image into ImageJ or extract an image from ImageJ. I can 
probably put and get images by title in a single module, wanted to see 
if people liked the initial direction before making it too fancy.

Hi everyone,

The LOCI offices will be going through some remodeling late next week, which
will impact our meeting schedule. Specifically, we are pushing Barry's
status report back by a week.

Here is the updated schedule for ImageJDev meetings through the end of May.

Tuesdays, 10-11am CDT, Rm 274 ? group planning sessions for fleshing out the
project's technical directions.

Thursdays, 2:30-3:30pm CDT, Rm 224 ? rotating informal status reports. Each
week, one of us will present recent work and discuss any open questions.

The tentative schedule is as follows:
Thu 13 May, 2:30pm - NO MEETING (LOCI under construction)
Tue 18 May, 10am - Discuss ROIs: java.awt.geom, JHotDraw, OME-XML
Thu 20 May, 2:30pm - Barry: progress on ImageJ unit testing
Tue 25 May, 10am - Discuss scripting & plugins: Java 6 Scripting Framework
Thu 27 May, 2:30pm - Curtis: overall status and next steps

In preparation for the ROI meeting, I will send out a ROI summary email on
either Sunday or Monday.

Hi everyone,

I have created pages on the imagejdev.org site for the five main areas of
ImageJ development: Data, Display, I/O, ROIs and Customization (scripts,
plugins, etc.). Most of these topics still need to be fleshed out, but on
the ROI page I have summarized many of the recent discussions.

Please see: http://imagejdev.org/regions-interest

We can use this page as a rough agenda for discussion for tomorrow's meeting
(10am CST). If you have time before then, and you are planning to attend,
please review it!

Thanks,
Curtis

Message-ID: <AANLkTilVro1HNYpMRbB7Gf9f0Ks2VdPHhrWAVkDzfjJ9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Today the ImageJDev team met to discuss regions of interest in ImageJ, and
as part of that discussion, we were looking at the 2010-09 proposal (
http://www.ome-xml.org/wiki/ROI/ProposalSeptember2010). Barry suggested that
the "Display Options" section is distinct from the rest of the ROI model, in
that it describes how to render a ROI, rather than its geometric
representation in model space.

Would it make sense to break out the Display Options into a separate element
(e.g., ROIDisplay), linked back to the ROI? (This could be similar to the
old "DisplayOptions" element, but for ROIs.) Doing so would allow two or
more displays to store separate display options for the same ROI.

Hi Curtis,

We've just moved the description of the ROIShape from the  
ShapeDisplayOptions onto shape, there are several reasons for this:
* It helps on the server side, simplifying the queries for retrieving  
shape info (no joins on a potentially large table).
* One of the reasons we've got display settings on shape rather than  
ROI is to compensate for the lack of ROI-ROI links, so an ROI could  
define the change of state of an object via text attribute
* We also are looking at using ROI/ROIShape to do more than just  
define ROI on an image, but to store other UI geometries.
* It was the way I coded up the measurement tool :)

This proposal is definitely not set in stone, I can see it being more  
advantageous to move the display settings to ROI and therefore make  
ROIShape deal strictly geometry when we get ROI-ROI Link.
I am quite dubious about  moving DisplayOptions to a separate table to  
allow more displays to store separate display options for ROI, as the  
trade of off performance (joins on table) vs use-case is debatable.

We are going to have a minigroup to discuss ROI and modeling, it's  
provisionally set for Friday (28th May) at 2pm, anyone who's  
interested is welcome to join us via Skype, Teamspeak.

Also  If any one is coming to Paris we can certainly discuss use-cases  
and talk about any changes that maybe required.

BTW, You may not be aware of the proposed changes to ROI to  
accommodate 3D ROI, http://ome-xml.org/browser/Documentation/Graphics/ROI/2010-09/Ome-ROI-overview-Proposal-2010-09.png 
.

Regards

D.

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Today's meeting rescheduled due to construction
Message-ID: <AANLkTilB5iCP2Sn-iTrjGPykIJ-Vcvt4o64lzSJQtE_F@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Sorry for the late notice, but the construction at LOCI is not quite
finished, and various people are absent or out sick, so we are pushing
today's ImageJ planning meeting (scripts & plugins) to next Tuesday at 10am.

Thu 27 May, 2:30pm - Barry: progress on ImageJ unit testing
Tue 1 June, 10am - Discuss scripting & plugins: Java 6 Scripting Framework

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Biweekly milestones
Message-ID: <AANLkTimzOvv2FOPB23iQUV-gn8yDN39Mqj_ucM4P82tz@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

As discussed during today's status report, I have configured biweekly
milestones through the end of the year on the ImageJ Trac. You can view them
at:
  http://imagejdev.org/trac/imagej/roadmap

Please use these milestones as a todo list over the course of each two-week
interval. These milestones will serve as an organizational tool, quick
reference and declaration to the community of how we are directing our
individual efforts.

Associated tickets (filed by logging in and clicking the "new ticket" button
on the top right) need not be complex?just one or two lines to remind
yourself of the task. When you can, try to break it down to actual "next
physical action" style tasks (see
http://zenhabits.net/why-whats-the-next-action-is-the-most-important-question/for
a nice article about this), even if you list more than one "next
action"
on the same ticket sometimes.

Cycles will begin on alternating Mondays (starting this Tuesday, June 1, due
to Memorial Day). On these Mondays, we will review our progress on the
previous cycle, troubleshoot any roadblocks with existing tickets, push
incomplete work into the next cycle, etc. On these Mondays, we can do this
instead of our usual "stand-up" meeting. Grant, it would be good if you
could join us for these biweekly reviews?we usually meet around 10:30am CST
(11:30am CST).

Please let me know if you have any questions about it!

-Curtis
