<PRE>Hi Tobias,

IMHO <A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imglib/compare/dog">https://github.com/imagej/imglib/compare/dog</A> shows it better ;-)

&gt;<i> I would have merged to master, but I'm having slight reservations

</I>
Actually, I am happy to see that the reluctance to add dependencies has
waned a bit ;-)

&gt;<i> First a dependency on imglib2-meta, this is for convenience to use
</I>&gt;<i> calibration of ImgPlus and could be possibly removed.
</I>
Note that imglib2-meta *will* depend on scijava-common soon, to avoid
wheel reinvention. That is not a big problem IMO because scijava-common is
developed very carefully, avoiding at high maintenance cost to introduce
backwards-incompatibilities or other possibly breaking changes. So I'm all
for it.

&gt;<i> Second is a dependency on JAMA.
</I>
Steffi identified a hard crash (IIRC) with some JVMs that we fixed in
Fiji. We used to call that &quot;version 1.0.2&quot; but that is wrong, of course.
We should probably call it &quot;1.0.3-fiji1&quot; or some such; question is whether
we want to care about those JVM crashes at all? After all, those JVMs have
been superseded by later JVMs that apparently do not expose those crashes.

&gt;<i> What is your opinion? Is it okay to add these dependencies? Or should I
</I>&gt;<i> rather move this stuff to some other place? If so, where?
</I>
As I said, I like to avoid reinventing the wheel and add dependencies
instead. The whole point of using Maven is to manage dependencies, after
all.

So: thumbs up from my side!

Ciao,
Dscho
