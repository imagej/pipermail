Message-ID: <857a86450911121504p45be723aq8280afa0ee6f2e7b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I have created this mailing list for the participants at imagejdev.org, for
technical discussion and collaboration regarding ImageJ development. Its
intended use is for core developer discussion, not user or developer support
questions (people can use the normal ImageJ mailing list for that).

Regards,
Curtis

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Git repository
Message-ID: <857a86450911161641hc5f130chbbb5268b7e174b08@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I set up a Git repository for the ImageJ project today. It's empty right now
(except for a placeholder readme.txt). The plan is for Grant to add a
refactored version according to his IjX procedure.

The repository is enabled for read-only public access:
  git clone git://imagejdev.org/imagej.git

Or read/write access (once your SSH public key is registered):
  git clone git at imagejdev.org:imagej.git

So, if you want commit access to the repository, send me an SSH public key,
and I'll add you.

None of this is documented on the web site yet.

For those curious, I am using Gitosis to serve the repository over SSH more
easily and securely, and git-daemon for the public read-only access. Next I
will be setting up the Trac with TracGitPlugin (but I'm not planning to set
up Gitweb unless people want it).

-Curtis
