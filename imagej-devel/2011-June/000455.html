<PRE>I think EventBus can serve us well, but I have run into a serious issue 
that demands that we move from EventBus version 1.2 to 1.4.

Because &quot;subscribers are called in the order in which they subscribed&quot;, 
we cannot use the EventBus (1.2) in ways that we need.  If I have a 
class which is watching things (say a ROI Manager or the Window menu 
list of open displays) it's behavior depends on when it was subscribed.  
I've been working on this for a week and I have not found a way to 
manage this.  Fortunately I discovered that as of version 1.3 there is a 
PrioritizedEventSubscriber  
(<A HREF="http://www.jarvana.com/jarvana/view/org/bushe/eventbus/1.3/eventbus-1.3-javadoc.jar!/org/bushe/swing/event/Prioritized.html">http://www.jarvana.com/jarvana/view/org/bushe/eventbus/1.3/eventbus-1.3-javadoc.jar!/org/bushe/swing/event/Prioritized.html</A>)  
I think this is just what we need.

(Using this priority mechanism may also eliminate the need for the 
ObjectsUpdatedEvent that I added last week.)

EventBus version 1.4 is here: 
<A HREF="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.bushe/eventbus/1.4">http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.bushe/eventbus/1.4</A>

We will need to change the Events framework a bit to add Prioritized 
Event Subscription, but otherwise I don't think it will require any 
refactoring except for the subscribers that need to set priority.
