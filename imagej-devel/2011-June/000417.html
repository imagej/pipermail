<PRE>Oops - doesn't quite work because the views deal with RandomAccessibles 
or RandomAccess. I need one that works off of IterableIntervals and 
Cursors. I think that an IterableInterval is a considerably constrained 
case - you could translate it or reflect it or transpose axes, but very 
little else (I don't think even periodic makes sense).

For a few seconds I was really excited because I didn't have to do any 
extra work, so please, someone tell me that I'm wrong and it's easy to 
do in the current code base.
