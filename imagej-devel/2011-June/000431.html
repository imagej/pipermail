</I>&gt;<i>                       is nan or null.
</I>&gt;<i>                     + The value in space along the missing axis is the
</I>&gt;<i>                       same at all locations along that axis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The former behavior makes sense to me, but I'm having a tough time 
</I>&gt;<i> understanding the latter. Could you give an example?
</I>If someone selects a rectangular region at some Z plane, maybe they mean 
to analyze the region not just at that z-plane but at all z-planes. For 
instance, I have one of those (beautiful) drosophila embryos in 3-d, but 
it's z-planes for the current ImageJ 2.0 release. I draw a rectangle 
around it and want to crop to it. I probably want to get the image at 
its complete depth, not just one plane. The user should be able to choose.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * Perhaps there is a SpatialDataObject or perhaps the
</I>&gt;<i>           DataObject is always spatial. In any case, the axis
</I>&gt;<i>           information and channel metadata should be pushed up the
</I>&gt;<i>           inheritance hierarchy so that Overlay has a first-class
</I>&gt;<i>           representation of that and operations that generate overlays
</I>&gt;<i>           from datasets copy the information to the overlays they create.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hrm... it seems to me that Overlays are always spatial, but what about 
</I>&gt;<i> datasets? How are we planning on storing derived data (eg: a table of 
</I>&gt;<i> measurement values)?
</I>I think Dataset is always an image, right?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * There is a spectral dimension, but the channel axis doesn't
</I>&gt;<i>           capture that. Channels are categorical and should have names
</I>&gt;<i>           so they can be matched in the same way that axes are matched.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the idea that the Display will ask its DataObjects for color 
</I>&gt;<i> information right? I'm thinking about what happens when a dataset has 
</I>&gt;<i> a spectral dimension and a channels dimension... not sure if there's a 
</I>&gt;<i> case for this, or how to handle it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think that would play out as a spectral dimension with its own axis 
and a categorical channels dimension with its own axis.
&gt;<i> Thanks!
