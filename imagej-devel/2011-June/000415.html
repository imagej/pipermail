<PRE>Hi Stephans,
I have this case - you have some region of interest represented by a 
binary bitmap and the bitmap, for one reason or another is offset in 
space (In Yiddish: it's &quot;in mitten drinnen&quot;, don't know if that 
translates to German and there's a good chance that the way it was used 
in my family is the exact opposite of its literal meaning) but otherwise 
is best suited as an array. You don't want to represent it using an 
ArrayImg&lt;BitType&gt; because everything from the origin to the first pixel 
will be uniformly false, otherwise, the ArrayImg is the right choice. 
The obvious solution here is to have some sort of adapter object to hold 
the Img and for it to do some lying about where the thing is in space - 
every Localizable and Positionable needs to be wrapped in something that 
adds or subtracts the offset.

Is that a reasonable thing to add to Imglib? Where would it live and 
what would you call it? Also, an Img isn't Localizable and Positionable 
and perhaps this thing should be?

Thx,
--Lee
