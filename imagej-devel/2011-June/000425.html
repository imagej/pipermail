<PRE>Hi
Great to see the alpha 3 out. Not sure if people are happy for comments at 
this stage, but just in case... All comments are made with a positive intent.

For some reason, the images (for example the Clown sample) when enlarged, the 
first and last rows and columns of pixels appear to have pixels that are half 
the size of the rest of the image pixels. (Sure pixels do not have area, but 
for positioning of ROIs and so on perhaps they should be represented as the 
rest of the pixels).

I see that ROIs have a black border around. Is there any plan to be able to 
turn that off? Otherwise we cannot see what is underneath the ROI. Or perhaps 
best to make these semi transparent? Or with dotted lines in alternating 
colours?  I see lots of room for confusion in terms of what is the image and 
what is overlay or things disappearing because the overlay having the same 
colour as the background.

Something I noted in IJ1 is that having lots of overlays being shown makes it 
run very slow. Has anybody noticed this? Maybe they get refreshed/repainted 
too often. I wonder if it is worth looking at the performance of having ROIs 
as overlays as they appear in the alpha 3.

I also noted that the black border around images cannot be switched off in the 
Edit Options. I wonder if this is related to the half pixel display mentioned 
above.

Regards to all,

Gabriel
