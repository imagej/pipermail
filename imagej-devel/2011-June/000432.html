<PRE>I've added a line style to overlays - dashes, dots, dot-dashes and none 
(= outline disappears) in addition to Solid.

For the current design, I think that ROI painting will still be slow and 
will need to be optimized. I'm thinking that first-class support of 
image segmentations will mean that more users will do things like 
particle analysis which will generate a large number of ROIs. We could 
be clever here and, because the ROIs are derived from a single labeling, 
the labeling could be represented as a first-class object in the UI 
instead of as a collection of ROIs (but still allowing individual ROIs 
to be selected) by having a labeling DataObject similar to Overlay. 
There would be a corresponding view which would be rendered as one 
bitmap; it's fast to both generate the bitmap (two passes over the 
labeling within the currently displayed plane) and economical to store 
and display its graphical object.

Are there any other use cases that generate a large number of ROIs?
