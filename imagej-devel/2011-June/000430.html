<PRE>Hi Lee,

These are great observations, and I agree that the sooner they are addressed
the better. I looked at the Skype channel, and it appears there hasn't been
much discussion on this, so I figured I'd see if I could get a bit of
clarification on a couple things below...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - There are two behaviors for a view object that does not have an axis
</I>&gt;<i>       in the space. Perhaps the user selects the behavior?:
</I>&gt;<i>          - The value in space outside of a single plane defined by a
</I>&gt;<i>          coordinate location along the axis is nan or null.
</I>&gt;<i>          - The value in space along the missing axis is the same at all
</I>&gt;<i>          locations along that axis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The former behavior makes sense to me, but I'm having a tough time
</I>understanding the latter. Could you give an example?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Perhaps there is a SpatialDataObject or perhaps the DataObject is
</I>&gt;<i>    always spatial. In any case, the axis information and channel metadata
</I>&gt;<i>    should be pushed up the inheritance hierarchy so that Overlay has a
</I>&gt;<i>    first-class representation of that and operations that generate overlays
</I>&gt;<i>    from datasets copy the information to the overlays they create.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hrm... it seems to me that Overlays are always spatial, but what about
</I>datasets? How are we planning on storing derived data (eg: a table of
measurement values)?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - There is a spectral dimension, but the channel axis doesn't capture
</I>&gt;<i>    that. Channels are categorical and should have names so they can be matched
</I>&gt;<i>    in the same way that axes are matched.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the idea that the Display will ask its DataObjects for color information
</I>right? I'm thinking about what happens when a dataset has a spectral
dimension and a channels dimension... not sure if there's a case for this,
or how to handle it.

Thanks!
-Adam
