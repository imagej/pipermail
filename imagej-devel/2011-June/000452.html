My experience is that when people are forced to adapt two paradigms into 
one, either the outcome is better than any of the previous attempts, or 
the people do not speak to each other anymore :-)

Seriously again, I think that we're on a good track here, because what Lee 
does is indeed the implementation side of something that is pretty well 
defined in the OME standard.

So all is good.

</I>
How about &quot;Meh!&quot;?

:<i>-)

Ciao,
Johannes
