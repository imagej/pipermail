<PRE>Dear Grant,

On Thu, 8 Sep 2011, Grant B. Harris wrote:

&gt;<i> -- A &quot;Default&quot; IJ2 Scripting Language
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think when we speak of a script, we are referring to a 'high-level',

</I>&gt;<i> The ImageJ Macro language is certainly such a thing; so perhaps the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since existing IJ1 Macros will continue to function through the Legacy 
</I>&gt;<i> layer, we could 'migrate' the IJ1 Macro language to BeanShell with some 
</I>&gt;<i> changes that make it consonant with Java/C; that way users of IJ1 macros 
</I>&gt;<i> would only need to understand the changes, but would otherwise find it 
</I>&gt;<i> familiar.
</I>
It is much &quot;worse&quot; than that: existing users already know the macro 
language. So there is not even a single bit of an option. On the other 
hand, it relieves us from yet another decision.

As to Beanshell, I think I already listed the problems with that?

&gt;<i> -- Script Execution
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The real value of the Java 6 ScriptingEngine is that it provides 
</I>&gt;<i> execution polyglotinousness.  ;-0 So plugins/modules written in any 
</I>&gt;<i> suppported language can be easily used by a naive user.
</I>
The problem is that the ScriptingEngine does not provide half the methods 
we require.

&gt;<i> -- 'Macro' Recording
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The ability to record events (macros) is useful for:
</I>&gt;<i>     - creating a sequence of actions that the user just wants to repeat.  
</I>&gt;<i>       In this case, the language used for the encoding is not important, 
</I>&gt;<i>       as long as it works.
</I>&gt;<i>     - creating code that is the basis for a script or program that they 
</I>&gt;<i>       want to write.  In this case, the user wants a choice of the 
</I>&gt;<i>       language for the code that results from the recording.
</I>
No question about that.

&gt;<i> -- Development Tools
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     - Interactive Interpreter provides:
</I>&gt;<i>         - single stepping
</I>&gt;<i>         - keeping states and evaluating incrementally
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The interpretted scripting languages have interactive consoles that can be
</I>&gt;<i> embedded in an application. (e.g. BeanShell and Jython have an interactive
</I>&gt;<i> console, Clojure has its REPL.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     - Code Editor provides
</I>&gt;<i>         - syntax highlighting
</I>&gt;<i>         - code completion
</I>&gt;<i>         - refactoring
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     An editor may be integrated with an interactive console, allowing one or
</I>&gt;<i> more lines to be selected and interpretted/executed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     - Debugger might provide:
</I>&gt;<i>         - single stepping
</I>&gt;<i>         - setting breakpoints
</I>&gt;<i>         - state inspector of objects and variables
</I>&gt;<i>         - setting watches
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Jython has a debugging framework
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.jython.org/docs/library/bdb.html">http://www.jython.org/docs/library/bdb.html</A>) and there are a variety of
</I>&gt;<i> debugging tools that we might possible incorportate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What development tools can we realisticly provide?  At some point a developer
</I>&gt;<i> may be better served by an IDE.  Eclipse and NetBeans have plugins for most of
</I>&gt;<i> the languages of consequence.
</I>
Good luck with integrating Eclipse and/or NetBeans seamlessly into IJ2. I 
really mean it, have you considered what it takes?

Ciao,
Johannes
