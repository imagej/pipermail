<PRE>Hi,

I also like the separation (obviously!).

As to Maven: when I had to use it last time, it was very slow, but I am 
known to be impatient.

I agree, though, that it solves an important problem: every source code 
repository of a non-trivial library seems to come with precompiled 
3rd-party components. And if you use several of such libraries, you may 
end up with different versions of the same 3rd-party component in the 
classpath. Not good (remember the JNA cleanup I did recently? That was 
_exactly_ that issue: jruby.jar's jna was hopelessly obsolete).

So I provided a script in Fiji (bin/maven.sh) which downloads and runs 
maven, exactly because it will be useful in the future.

Ciao,
Dscho

P.S.: if you're interested why I made that script originally: I did it 
between when Albert mentioned that clojure-contrib is a Maven'ized Git 
repository now, and when Albert mentioned that clojure-contrib is no 
longer necessary for our Clojure stuff... ;-)
