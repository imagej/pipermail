<PRE>Hi everyone,

Over the past few months, we have been using Git for source control of the
ImageJ2 effort. However, for a number of reasons, I would like to migrate
the repository to Subversion instead. I am soliciting feedback from anyone
who has a preference one way or the other, as well as input on the issues
below, so that we can reach a consensus as a group.

1) Git support on Windows is weak compared to SVN

Our current Git workflow on Windows is to install msysGit, optionally
TortoiseGit (which requires msysGit), as well as Putty/Pageant, for proper
handling of SSH keys. And we're still struggling to make this configuration
work. Conversely, for SVN, we install TortoiseSVN, add the user through the
Trac administrative interface, they type their password the first time they
perform a commit, and it is cached thereafter. Security-wise this is
probably inferior, but it is much easier to set up.

2) Git support in NetBeans is weak compared to SVN

NetBeans interfaces with Git through the NBGit plugin, which is only
partially implemented. For example, I could not figure out how to switch
branches using NBGit. Conversely, NetBeans has full built-in support for
SVN. TortoiseGit provides an alternative GUI-based solution, but is
unfortunately several times slower than command line Git.

3) Git allows dangerous operations like rewriting history and deleting
branches

In some ways this is great, and it's a pain that Subversion doesn't.
However, there is a certain security in knowing that no matter what you do
in SVN, you can always backtrack. For example, the other day I accidentally
deleted the old ijx branch containing Grant's original refactoring work, and
did not realize it until later. In this case it is not catastrophic, but it
scares me that users can so easily delete big chunks of the repository. Even
if it is possible to undo, I simply do not know enough about Git to know how
to do so, or even necessarily realize such a thing has happened.

4) Git does not allow partial tree checkouts of the repository

With SVN you can checkout a subtree of the repository, allowing you to place
a large number of modules off the root, and instruct people to check out and
build only what they want (and Maven makes this especially easy). AFAIK you
cannot do this with a single Git repository, but would need one Git
repository per module instead&#8212;which then complicates checking out the entire
umbrella of projects instead. I know submodules are a partial solution, but
they have their own problems as well.

5) Git uses non-linear versioning, making it more difficult to refer to
development builds

The fact that every checkout of Subversion is linear and has a monotonically
increasing number is exceedingly useful for stamping builds. With Git, AFAIK
you can't easily do this. An article at
<A HREF="https://wincent.com/blog/automatic-deployment-numbering-in-git">https://wincent.com/blog/automatic-deployment-numbering-in-git</A> discusses a
possible workaround, but it is deployment-based. We want the revision number
to match a particular snapshot of code, so that external developers can
easily check out that particular revision and get source code that matches
the build in question.

6) Git is harder to understand and use than SVN

Apologies in advance if this statement starts a flame-war. However, I've
witnessed the vast majority of developers with whom I've interacted struggle
with Git's learning curve compared to SVN. In particular, I am personally
frustrated with the complication of local branches vs. remote ones. And I
know that the choice of Git has been a barrier to adoption for Grant as
well&#8212;as mentioned above, Git's GUI tools, especially on Windows, are not as
polished as they are for SVN.

7) Our development server&#8212;Ubuntu, serving Git code using Gitosis&#8212;produces
mysterious (but seemingly harmless?) error messages; e.g.:

<A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-devel">curtis at rook</A>:~/code/LOCI/imagej$ git pull
error: ssh died of signal 13
Already up-to-date.

It's probably a minor issue, but I haven't been able to find a solution via
web searches.

8) Git does not integrate with Trac as well as SVN does

This is also a minor point, since the Git-Trac integration is actually quite
nice. However, there are a number of issues (documented at
<A HREF="http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GitPlugin">http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GitPlugin</A>)&lt;<A HREF="http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GitPlugin%29">http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GitPlugin%29</A>&gt;&#8212;in
particular, performance (#746) and branch display issues (#2633).

In conclusion, I am frankly frustrated with Git, and feel SVN would be an
easier choice for both our own development team as well as the larger ImageJ
community. However, I welcome discussion, as there are certainly downsides
to switching away from Git.
