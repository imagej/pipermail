<PRE>Hi all

</I>

So if I get the bug picture correctly and try to summarize it:

- ImageJ2 is a standalone software, that only contains BSD pieces. It 
uses as its core imglib2, and the concerned packages (core, io, nothing 
else, right?) are all BSDs. The BSD license was chosen to facilitate 
dissemination in other softwares, e.g. commercial ones (I am pretty sure 
I got it wrong there).

- Fiji is distribution that includes ImageJ2. It is GPL3 and as such 
allows extra goodies, such as the imglib2 packages that are not BSD, 
like the algorithms. imglib2 algos are GPL3 so that we constrain 
creations based on these algos to be GPL3: then we (Fiji community) can 
benefit.

Right?


Then the way to know what should go to core vs algorithms depend on what 
ImageJ2 want to offer. There might be a list of target features for 
ImageJ2: when they are all implemented, the IJ2 team know that the soft 
has reached version 1.0.

So, any part of imglib2 that is needed to complete this list of feature 
should go to the core.

In that view, Curtis said that having the ability to display histograms 
is a IJ2 core feature, so it should go to the core. The FloydSteinberg 
dithering is more like a plugin, so it can go to algorithms. But why 
algorithms could not be a single large package?

Does that make sense?

cheers
