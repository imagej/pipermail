<PRE>Hi Curtis,

Yeah, I agree. I should have made my point clearer: there is little gain
from hacking up this script:

<A HREF="https://github.com/fiji/ImageJA/blob/tools/jenkins-job.sh">https://github.com/fiji/ImageJA/blob/tools/jenkins-job.sh</A>

which calls

<A HREF="https://github.com/fiji/ImageJA/blob/tools/commit-new-version.sh">https://github.com/fiji/ImageJA/blob/tools/commit-new-version.sh</A>

and

<A HREF="https://github.com/fiji/ImageJA/blob/tools/sync-with-imagej.sh">https://github.com/fiji/ImageJA/blob/tools/sync-with-imagej.sh</A>

because it is so special-purpose. I fully agree that it makes sense to
have it in a public repository, which is why I put it into the
(independent) 'tools' branch of ImageJA. Not only can people look at it
(compare to <A HREF="http://t.co/nwh7hBfg">http://t.co/nwh7hBfg</A>) but I have a backup in case I want to
put the job somewhere else (which is how it ended up with our Jenkins in
the first place, for a long time, I was doing it manually).

OTOH it would be easy to hack up

<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imagej/blob/master/bin/jenkins-git-job.sh">https://github.com/imagej/imagej/blob/master/bin/jenkins-git-job.sh</A>

to make it as configurable as the Git-synchronizer: the first parameter
would be the SVN URL, and all subsequent parameters would be Git-SVN URLs
in the same style as for the Git-synchronizer.

But I'll do that only when we need it.

Ciao,
Dscho
