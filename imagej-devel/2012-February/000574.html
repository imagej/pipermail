It looked to me as if Jenkins was stuck somewhere. The progress which
supposedly advances whenever a test was performed did not advance at all
in the half hour I looked.

So I guess that there was something really awkward, such as an OOM
infinite loop, or some such.

In hindsight, I should have fired up JVisualVM and looked at the threads,
so that's what I will do next time when it happens again.

Ciao,
Dscho
