<PRE>Lots of good stuff in your email, Gabriel. Just to respond to one point, 
the &quot;all-connected-components&quot; segmentation algorithm I did in imglib 
lets you specify the connectedness using a structuring element. You can 
do 4 or 8 connectedness and it does segment in N dimensions... you can 
specify the connectedness there too. You can even increase the 
connectedness to encompass pixels that are 2 or more away to get a 
dilation effect, although that might be computationally expensive for 
large dilations.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> iterating clockwise doesn't make sense (objects with holes, objects that

</I>&gt;<i> I seem to remember somebody encoding holes ROIs in the opposite
</I>&gt;<i> direction of the boundary ROIs. I am not sure what advantage this has.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In some imaging packages I worked with before (notably Optimas, now defunct)
</I>&gt;<i> there were 2 different resolutions for the positioning, one for addressing the
</I>&gt;<i> image and one for ROIs. The ROIs were located (by default) on the centre of
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;pixels&quot;. I know that pixels are really points, but if you enlarge the
</I>&gt;<i> image, they look like squares, so it would be useful to really have an
</I>&gt;<i> intuitive positioning of the ROI nodes on the image.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are at least 8 different ways to encode a blob, depending whether the
</I>&gt;<i> ROI centres on the pixels belonging to the object boundary, on the background
</I>&gt;<i> bounday pixel centres or to the boundaries of the underlying grid, and whether
</I>&gt;<i> 4 or 8 connected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know, IJ uses the top left corner to position the polygon, but
</I>&gt;<i> then this creates an un-intuitive situation of the ROI not reaching the point
</I>&gt;<i> the it will paint if you fill the ROI.
</I>&gt;<i> ImageJ's polygon length computation is somewhat difficult to grasp. It does
</I>&gt;<i> not return the same length as the standard Freeman's algorithm (the difference
</I>&gt;<i> is not too large, but it is different). This needs to be investigated a bit, I
</I>&gt;<i> think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There used to be a problem (not sure if this is still there) that if you
</I>&gt;<i> filled ROI then get the ROI again the wand, then drew the
</I>&gt;<i> outline, it would be bigger by 1 pixel again to the right and down. Somehow
</I>&gt;<i> this does not seem to be the ideal. An ROI should define a blob, that when
</I>&gt;<i> filled and detected again with the want, the same boundary is detected.
</I>&gt;<i> Although I eventually became used to to live with it, I think it would be
</I>&gt;<i> better to avoid this in future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I contacted Curtis so he has my skype id and hope to join to -at least to
</I>&gt;<i> listen- about the progress tomorrow.
