It's probably cutting it a bit close for us, since we'll have a symposium 
about Fiji that runs until 4pm (and hopefully not over). So I will 
probably be late, but still try to attend.

But I can mention a few points I would like to hear raised:

- often it is necessary to be able to iterate the just-outside pixels and 
  the just-inside pixels. A trivial fallback strategy would be to wrap an 
  Iterator of all outside (or inside) pixels and test, and continue until 
  we find out that is on the boundary. Horribly slow, but robust.

- When measuring area and circumference, we should definitely realize that 
  we're working with sampled data, and consequentially we should always 
  have some +/- number with the value.

- 3D display of ROIs.

That last point is probably a bit philosophical, because it will only hit 
us in the future... So for now it's just necessary to keep in mind that 
we'll want to have them.

Ciao,
Dscho
