Please note that this is all in a flux at the moment. We're working on an 
imglib-ops package which should make writing performant filter very easy.

Hello All,

I wanted to report that we recently completed a successful ImageJDev/FIJI hackathon with developers from the Open Microscopy Environment, Cell Profiler, ITK, Micromanager among many others participating. It was a great success and special thanks to all the developers on this list who attended. We will be posting more information on the progress made at the hackathon at imagedev.org shortly. As always please contact Curtis or I if you have any questions about the timeline or direction of project.?


I also wanted to update on the personnel on the ImageJ Dev project. Rick Lentz has accepted a technology leadership position with the state and I invite you to join me in congratulating Rick on this great opportunity. Rick will be starting his new position next week. Please direct any questions about the OpenCL project to Curtis Rueden. We also have several new team members that will be getting more involved in the ImageJDev project, in particular two CS students Eric Alexander and Mark Hiner who are working on OME and ITK integration respectively.?


best

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Author info added to source code, and licensing
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=5R8p=RD0pZvRR6KsYJb0o++5_rDqHyhB992eJ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I added author details for every core ImageJDev class:
  http://dev.imagejdev.org/trac/imagej/changeset/2263

If you notice your name missing from a class you developed, please add
yourself.

We also still need to add a licensing blurb to the top of each class?I will
take care of that later. One question is: any preference between BSD and
Apache 2? Both licenses are "as free as possible" with respect to what
people can do with the code, which is what's needed. The BSD license is
simpler but has no protective language regarding patents, etc., whereas the
Apache 2 license includes a clause about patents but is incompatible with
GPLv2 (but OK with GPLv3).

Hi,

I just pushed a branch 'imglib2-cleanup' which I intend to merge into 
imglib2 (as discussed IRL, imglib2 should not have non-compiling stuff so 
that we can go to a stable version Real Soon Now).

The classes I removed fall into 5 categories:

- CanvasImage (algorithm), dunno what to do with that,

- shapelist: probably needs adjustements WRT the OutOfBounds changes,

- interpolation: same as shapelist,

- OutOfBoundsStrategyMirrorExpWindowing (outofbounds): dunno,

- sampler: you said that this package is no longer needed.

I changed three Positionable implementations, as they obviously just 
needed their moveTo() methods be renamed to move().

Stephans (including Stephan 3): are you okay with merging this into 
the imglib2 branch?

Ciao,
Dscho

Johannes, the lib is changing too much at the moment. Wait until
Preibisch gets over his defense (this coming week) and he'll address
the various issues with out of bounds and the algorithms package. And
as far as I've seen, Tobias and Saalfeld are working on the lib every
day, tweaking performance of the core and addressing general structure
issues. I've been fixing algorithms and the scripting package, keeping
up with changes in the core.

>From what I've seen, the lib will enter a feature-freeze by the end of
this coming week or beginning of the next. Then it's the time to
cleanup.

Albert

We started removing stuff from imglib2 branch as well, but it's not
pushed yet (Stephan had to leave before we were finished cleaning up). 
- Stephan, could you just push the changes we made so far? -

I guess we already made most of the changes that are imglib2-cleanup.

ShapeList compiles (I think Albert fixed it) but there is still some
renaming to do to fit the new Interface names. So we thought to put
it in the imglib2 branch, noting that is still subject to change.

I'm also fine with removing it for now until it can be considered
stable.

> - interpolation: same as shapelist,

Will not be in the imglib2 branch now.
I'm working on that currently in the imglib2-dirty branch.
Should be ready by Monday, then we can put it back into imglib2.

me neither...

> - sampler: you said that this package is no longer needed.

true. Samplers (Cursor, RandomAccess) are now in the same package as
their respective containers. I think that was a very good decision.
Besides having everything in one place now, it has also the advantage
that Cursors can have access to package private members of their
containers.

Stephan is working on fixing those, as well.

Let's wait until Stephan 1 pushes.
I think that the imglib2-cleanup changes will be already in imglib2.

Cheers,
Tobias

Hi Tobias and all ImgLibers,

on Friday afternoon, Johannes, Tobias and me (Preibisch is still busy
currently) had a discussion on how to proceed with ImgLib2 development
in a way that we do not block each other.  The result of the discussion
was that Tobias and me will branch off the current imglib2 branch into
the branch imglib2-dirty and remove everything that is not working
currently from imglib2.  That way, imglib2 will be a reduced but working
library to work with.  Those that develop imglib2 will keep working on
the new branch imglib2-dirty and, whenever anything is fixed, move it
into imglib2.  Those that develop anything using imglib2 as a library
will use the imglib2 branch.

This procedure will be done by Monday.  It includes that we consider the
design of the imglib2 core as stable from Monday on.  I am saying this
because we made a last noticeable change on Thursday night.  Here come
the rationals:

* We made RandomAccessibleInterval extend RandomAccessible (as well for
real) because there is no way to generate a
RandomAccess-with-OutOfBounds without a
RandomAccess-without-OutOfBounds.

* We found that the term Container does not exist in the hierarchy of
ImgLib2 any more.  It is equivalent to Img.  For Img being shorter than
Container and everybody using Img meanwhile, we decided to replace all
references to the term Container by Img instead of vice versa.  We
cleaned up some inconsistencies in the naming scheme for Img
implementing classes.  Check the updated diagram, it makes total sense.
The term Container can still be used in informal speaking about an Img
but Img is preferred.  An Img is random accessible and iterable pixel
data in an interval whose min coordinates are at 0^n.  Modifying the T
accessed through an ImgSampler<T> will change the data in the Img<T>.  A
follow-up to the same location will return the changed value.  That is,
a ShapeList is not an Img!


Another issue:

ImgLib2 aims at compile time type safety.  We will therefore remove
runtime test constructs from the imglib core.  If needed at all, they
can go to the (sub)-project where they are required, e.g. type-checking
in imglib-io or imglib-algorithm.

Renaming doesn't do it, move is meant relative, moveTo was not and is out.

I've pushed the half done cleanup into imglib2, more coming soon.
Despite respecting your efforts, it is easier for Tobias and me to
continue with what we've done in agreement with our discussion than
reviewing what you, Johannes, have done that we didn't know about.

Best regards,
Stephan
