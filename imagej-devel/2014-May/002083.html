<PRE>Hi Pawel,

&gt;<i> I am really glad you are open to collaboration. Like you said, there
</I>&gt;<i> is definitely a learning curve, so I will try to get acquainted with
</I>&gt;<i> the current codebase and drop in on #imagejdev for questions.
</I>
Sounds good.

&gt;<i> I am happy to work on documentation while I am getting up to speed
</I>&gt;<i> with the code.
</I>
Great, that would be really helpful.

&gt;<i> Most of my itches are actually GUI-related, but from what I've
</I>&gt;<i> gathered you are not planning to initially change the GUI much from
</I>&gt;<i> what it was in 1.x for compatibility reasons. Maybe once I understand
</I>&gt;<i> the code structure a little better, I can help with work on the Swing,
</I>&gt;<i> AWT, or RCP GUIs for the later releases. I'll be keeping in touch.
</I>
Right, there are two very different modes: the ImageJ 1.x user interface,
and the ImageJ 2.x Swing UI. The latter is (at the moment) designed to
function much like the former, although we will probably diverge more from
ImageJ 1.x's design in the future.

To facilitate total backwards compatibility, as well as to accommodate
Wayne Rasband's continued development of ImageJ 1.x, we are now opting to
release ImageJ 2.0.0 running with the 1.x UI by default. You can still
switch to the ImageJ2 UI using Help &gt; Switch to Modern Mode, but it has
more limitations compatibility-wise.

I would encourage you to discuss your UI ideas and requirements on
imagej-devel or in the #imagejdev IRC channel (i.e., somewhere public).
That way we can stay on the same page about what things are possible and
warranted within each user interface.

I look forward to hearing more from you!

Regards,
Curtis

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Pawel,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks very much for your interest in the ImageJ project! I'm CCing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> imagej-devel mailing list, since that is the best place to discuss
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ImageJ2 core development.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; ImageJ is one of my all-time favorite pieces of software and I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; like to contribute to its development. I have a decent knowledge of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; Java, but I haven't really worked on an open source project before. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; saw that the list of contributors on the ImageJ github page is pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; limited and so I am wondering if you generally like outside people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; contributing to the codebase or whether you prefer to keep it within
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; the core development team.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of the major goals of ImageJ2 is to support a more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community-oriented group of developers. Requests like yours are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> surprisingly rare because most people do not have a lot of free time to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contribute to projects like ImageJ. But your help would definitely be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most welcome.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; If you welcome new devs, what features/bugfixes do you think are most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; critical at the moment?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would encourage you to first &quot;scratch your own itches&quot; [1]. You can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get started right away: fork the relevant project(s) from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/imagej">https://github.com/imagej</A> and <A HREF="https://github.com/scijava,">https://github.com/scijava,</A> push changes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to topic branches, and file pull requests [2]. (And if you need an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> introduction to Git: <A HREF="https://try.github.io/">https://try.github.io/</A>).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you really don't have any itches and just want to fix bugs, that's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bit trickier at the moment, since you would need to become more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acquainted with the ImageJ2 project structure -- and it is still in beta
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and documentation is scarce in many places.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It might make the most sense for you to jump into the ImageJ chat room
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (#imagejdev) on IRC freenode during U.S. business hours and chat with us
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at more length. One way you could start helping the project right away
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be transform any information you learn there into wiki pages on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the ImageJ wiki (<A HREF="http://wiki.imagej.net/">http://wiki.imagej.net/</A>).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We are gearing up for an initial release of ImageJ 2.0.0 (finally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leaving beta!) on June 1, so your timing is hectic, but also really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fantastic to help improve the project documentation and learn the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system, so that you can embark on more involved coding endeavors.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
