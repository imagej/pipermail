<PRE>Hi Pawel,

Thanks very much for your interest in the ImageJ project! I'm CCing the
imagej-devel mailing list, since that is the best place to discuss ImageJ2
core development.

&gt;<i> ImageJ is one of my all-time favorite pieces of software and I would
</I>&gt;<i> like to contribute to its development. I have a decent knowledge of
</I>&gt;<i> Java, but I haven't really worked on an open source project before. I
</I>&gt;<i> saw that the list of contributors on the ImageJ github page is pretty
</I>&gt;<i> limited and so I am wondering if you generally like outside people
</I>&gt;<i> contributing to the codebase or whether you prefer to keep it within
</I>&gt;<i> the core development team.
</I>
One of the major goals of ImageJ2 is to support a more community-oriented
group of developers. Requests like yours are surprisingly rare because most
people do not have a lot of free time to contribute to projects like
ImageJ. But your help would definitely be most welcome.

&gt;<i> If you welcome new devs, what features/bugfixes do you think are most
</I>&gt;<i> critical at the moment?
</I>
I would encourage you to first &quot;scratch your own itches&quot; [1]. You can get
started right away: fork the relevant project(s) from
<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej">https://github.com/imagej</A> and <A HREF="https://github.com/scijava,">https://github.com/scijava,</A> push changes to
topic branches, and file pull requests [2]. (And if you need an
introduction to Git: <A HREF="https://try.github.io/">https://try.github.io/</A>).

If you really don't have any itches and just want to fix bugs, that's a bit
trickier at the moment, since you would need to become more acquainted with
the ImageJ2 project structure -- and it is still in beta and documentation
is scarce in many places.

It might make the most sense for you to jump into the ImageJ chat room
(#imagejdev) on IRC freenode during U.S. business hours and chat with us at
more length. One way you could start helping the project right away would
be transform any information you learn there into wiki pages on the ImageJ
wiki (<A HREF="http://wiki.imagej.net/">http://wiki.imagej.net/</A>).

We are gearing up for an initial release of ImageJ 2.0.0 (finally leaving
beta!) on June 1, so your timing is hectic, but also really fantastic to
help improve the project documentation and learn the system, so that you
can embark on more involved coding endeavors.

Regards,
Curtis
