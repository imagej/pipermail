<PRE>Hi Curtis,

the problem occurred again, and I went on to investigate. The solution is
really easy: I made a serious mistake when bumping Color Inspector 3D to
the next release cycle over a year ago: 2.3 was released, but I switched
to 2.3-SNAPSHOT instead of 2.4-SNAPSHOT.

The &quot;SD20: Remove Snapshots From Repository&quot; job on our Maven server has
the checkbox &quot;Remove if released&quot; checked. Which makes sense, except when
you make a stupid mistake as I did.

Since I also released fiji-lib 2.0.0 yesterday, the same problem was
happening with fiji-lib, whose SNAPSHOT versions were deleted despite
pom-fiji still referencing them.

To remedy the problems, I updated pom-fiji, and I also told the &quot;Remove
Snapshots&quot; job to have a &quot;grace period after release&quot; of 31 days.

Ciao,
Dscho

</PRE>
