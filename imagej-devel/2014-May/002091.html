<PRE>Hi List

After seeing Pawel's e-mails, I also wanted to introduce myself and perhaps
become more involved with ImageJ2.

Like Pawel I've been exploring the ImageJ2 ecosystem recently (well for
over a year actually).  I'm coming at it from a developer's point of view.
I used to work in the commercial realm until 2011 (Media Cybernetics,
mostly on Autoquant).  After leaving that I did some unrelated things for a
couple of years.  I did have a non-compete agreement, but that is long
expired so I am thinking about getting back into microscopy.

I'm interested mainly in high performance applications.  A good example of
the type of project I'm interested in is GPU Deconvolution.  I've seen buzz
about a few GPU deconvolution apps recently (I've been able to explore
Stephan Preibisch's and Bob Pepin's work on Github).

When evaluating a GPU implementation, one would want to understand
state-of-the-art CPU implementations.  But how does one even determine what
is state-of-the-art??  How do you get the algorithms and test them in a
consistent fashion?  (I recently attended the ISBI Deconvolution Grand
Challenge addressing some aspects of this issue).   Further, it may not be
possible to produce the same results as CPU on a GPU implementation (memory
limitations, limited math libraries, etc.).  It becomes necessary to run
many tests and comparisons.  So to evaluate the benefits and trade-offs of
GPU deconvolution (or newish algorithms like wavelet approaches) it really
becomes important to have access to the older implementations.

For any new algorithm development, 90% of the problem (in my experience) is
understanding and evaluating what has been done before.  With open source
the great thing is that understanding the past is no longer just a
literature search;  it also involves getting the algorithms and running
them.

So I see &quot;uber-wrapper&quot; projects (a means to run and test multiple existing
implementations under the same framework) being very useful, and I've been
developing one for deconvolution with ImageJ2 (
<A HREF="https://github.com/bnorthan/projects">https://github.com/bnorthan/projects</A>).  Right now it wraps YacuDecu GPU
deconvolution [1], PSF generation in COSMOS [2] and an algorithm from ITK
deconvolution.  I've also ported a Total Variation implementation from
IOCBIOS [3] and non periodic boundary handling from EPFL [4] to imglib2
based implementations (similar design to imglib2 FFTConvolution [5]).
These few algorithms barely scratch the surface of what is out there.

As I've gotten multiple algorithms and components wrapped or ported as
ImageJ2 commands (or more recently a few ops) it has become simple to run
test scripts and to combine components in interesting and useful ways.

I'm not entirely sure how far I will be able to develop this.  Since I am
using some native components, it could become difficult to maintain and
distribute for multiple operating systems.  But at the very least I hope to
polish it and get it on a personal update site.  (Maybe isolating the java
only components, possibly snagging the PSF code from Icy[6]).

The Github link will be out of date soon as I need to clean and refactor
things a bit.  As I do this there may be an opportunity to contribute to
the Imagej-ops project or Imglib2.  One thing I need to do is take
inventory of all the little math functions I've written.  Where I've
re-invented the wheel I need to re-use the proper imagej-ops or imglib2
function instead.   If some math functions I have written are not in
imagej-ops/imgib I could take a look at implementing them.

Regards,

Brian

&gt;<i> Hi Curtis,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your comprehensive reply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Hi Pawel,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; I decided to start work on the project by playing around with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; ImageJ2 interface in some routine tasks I usually do in ImageJ. After
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; having done some extensive testing, I just wanted to give you some,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; hopefully constructive, input. I don't want to sound too negative, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; I really think that June 1st is a bit early to be releasing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; production version of ImageJ2.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With respect to the ImageJ2 Swing user interface and commands, you are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> absolutely right. However, the initial 2.0.0 release of ImageJ2 is going
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to continue using the classic ImageJ 1.x user interface by default. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new UI will still be included (Help &gt; Switch to Modern Mode) but will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still be very much in beta.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was actually under the impression that ImageJ2 IS the modern interface
</I>&gt;<i> and that it would be the default for the 2.0.0 release. I must have not
</I>&gt;<i> found the relevant blog/discussion posts. My bad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  See this blog post for details:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://developer.imagej.net/2014/04/01/imagej-200-stable-">http://developer.imagej.net/2014/04/01/imagej-200-stable-</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release-coming-spring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ImageJ 2.0.0 will be fundamentally the same as ImageJ1, but:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Will be bundled with the Updater component which supports ImageJ
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> update sites and automatic update checking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Will be bundled with the native ImageJ Launcher with quite a few nice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> command line features.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The imagej-win32.exe doesn't work in the build from about a week ago on my
</I>&gt;<i> machine (Just the basic command that launches the GUI). I'll submit a bug
</I>&gt;<i> report.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Will be bundled with the ImageJ Script Editor including support for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> several scripting languages.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am guessing it's the same as the FiJi script editor? In that case the
</I>&gt;<i> legacy UI should have a menu option File-&gt;New-&gt;Script, like FiJi does. In
</I>&gt;<i> addition, the plugins-&gt;new-&gt;plugin throws some sort of exception on first
</I>&gt;<i> use, again I'll submit a bug report.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Will support parameterized ImageJ modules, including commands and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts, so that existing plugins can begin incremental migration toward
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this new approach, which is more headless friendly and more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interoperable with tools such as CellProfiler, KNIME and OMERO.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good - I need to look into it more closely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Will come with an option to use the SCIFIO library when opening image
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files (e.g., using File &gt; Open). This will fix ImageJ's TIFF support to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be more robust, and add extensible support for additional file formats
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without needing to hack the HandleExtraFileTypes source.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Will ship with all the new ImageJ2 APIs, but all these components will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still be in beta. We will bring each component out of beta after it has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been thoroughly vetted over time. These components include:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - imagej-common: The ImgLib2-based image data model and core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - imagej-ops: A framework for reusable algorithms; see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://developer.imagej.net/2014/04/04/announcing-imagej-ops">http://developer.imagej.net/2014/04/04/announcing-imagej-ops</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - imagej-ui-swing: The &quot;pure ImageJ2&quot; Swing user interface
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - imagej-plugins-*, scijava-plugins-*: Core plugins for ImageJ2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including many commands
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Note that the Fiji distribution of ImageJ has been shipping of all of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these components, and operating in this way, for years now, and is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well vetted system. But it is time for these components to be officially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available as part of ImageJ's core, rather than only from a specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> life-sciences-focused ImageJ distribution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good. I've been using FiJi for quite some time now, so I didn't see
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;newness&quot; of the features.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; Please don't take it the wrong way - I am in the process of analysing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; the codebase and I think it is a real software engineering feat.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No offense taken at all; again, it is absolutely true that the ImageJ2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> UI needs more time in the oven. But meanwhile, it has already been over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> four years since we launched the ImageJ2 project, and there are several
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very mature components that need to get into the hands of users: the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Updater, the Launcher, the Script Editor, parameterized modules, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything else that is now part of the &quot;SciJava Common&quot; component
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common">https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common</A>).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because ImageJ2 consists of several pieces at various stages of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development, it needs to migrate out of beta piece by piece.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; It shows that there has been really serious thought put into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; architerctural design. However, at this point, and I am saying that as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; a daily ImageJ user, the architectural brilliance is not showing on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; the surface.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am glad you like the design. And I agree that much more needs to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done in terms of leveraging that design for the benefit of end users.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is an area where your contributions could be really beneficial.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; I am going to submit some bug reports in a few days, but basically the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; interface is highly unpredictable and in many ways incompatible with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; ImageJ1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed. Please note that there are many bugs about such problems already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> logged in the ImageJ Trac: <A HREF="http://trac.imagej.net/.">http://trac.imagej.net/.</A> We are actively in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the process of migrating away from the Trac system though, with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual tickets being moved to GitHub Issues of the most relevant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repository. Unfortunately, since we are in the middle of that migration,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it may be difficult to verify whether an issue has already been filed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for any particular concern. When in doubt, file away and we can close
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any duplicate issues accordingly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; Let me just point to a few basic things before I submit detailed bug
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; reports:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; 1. The brightness/contrast dialog sometimes sticks around when you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; open a new image and close the old one - you end up with multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; brightness/contrast dialogs and a single image. Moreover, I've had the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; dialog stay open even after I closed the application.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The IJ2 version of B&amp;C has been the subject of frequent debate. In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> short, it needs a lot more work. See <A HREF="http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1100">http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1100</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and all its blocking tickets (those listed in &quot;Blocked by&quot;).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; 2. The color picker behavior is hectic and I couldn't figure out how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; and why it randomly changes color. Especially in 16-bit per channel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; images it is totally unpredictable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; 3. With 48-bit 16-bit per channel composite images the drawing command
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; with the white color selected basically draws random grey colors.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IJ2's current approach to foreground and background &quot;colors&quot; differs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from IJ1. And there are likely bugs, too.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * <A HREF="http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/965">http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/965</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * <A HREF="http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1292">http://trac.imagej.net/ticket/1292</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; 4. The interface is extremely slow to the point of being unusable for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; things like looking through time-course stacks or stacks of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; medium-sized multicolor images.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is not a problem we have noticed, unless image planes become very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> large. How large are your image planes? &gt;2Kx2K?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are not large images (1kx1k/48-bit/10 z-planes), but mind you, I am
</I>&gt;<i> not using the latest hardware. However, I think many of ImageJ users will
</I>&gt;<i> not be on modern hardware, and my computer can run Photoshop CS4 with ease,
</I>&gt;<i> which is an indication that it is not a piece of junk, either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; 5. Shape selection keeps old selections after you make a new one,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; which is inconsistent with ImageJ1 behavior and quite maddening for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; someone who is used to it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes. We will probably need an option for it, because for many new users,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is maddening to have one ROI disappear when creating another. But the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> main reason IJ2's UI works that way right now is technical: it currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uses the JHotDraw library which works that way by default.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; 6. Missing magic wand and text tool functionality.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imagej-plugins-tools/issues/8">https://github.com/imagej/imagej-plugins-tools/issues/8</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imagej-plugins-tools/issues/9">https://github.com/imagej/imagej-plugins-tools/issues/9</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; 7. Missing custom toolbars.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Known, but no explicit issue for it yet. Low priority, given all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other things the Swing UI needs first. Note that IJ2 is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intrinsically limited to 8 tools like ImageJ1 is, so it is less urgent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to support customization. All available tools will be present in the bar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by default.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK. It would be nice if the toolbar were easily customizable by the user
</I>&gt;<i> the way the old style custom toolbars were. Also, having custom
</I>&gt;<i> floating/docking toolbars would be nice. I am thinking
</I>&gt;<i> photoshop/illustrator here, or at least Office &lt;2003. I don't think you
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily need to implement an RCP-style interface to have those.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; 8. In multicolor images there seems to be no way of adjusting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; brightness/contrast of each channel individually.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hmm, you're right. This might be a relatively new bug.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's an absolutely essential feature for any microscopy work. I'll
</I>&gt;<i> submit the bug report.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; 9. LIF format import doesn't work - it doesn't present the usual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; BioFormats dialog and instead just imports the first image in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; series with some random channel separation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LIF format does not work with vanilla ImageJ1 either. It is handled by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Bio-Formats plugin. We do not ship Bio-Formats with ImageJ2 because:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A) ImageJ2 is BSD-2 licensed, and the Bio-Formats proprietary file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> format readers have an incompatible GPL license; and B) ImageJ2 is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supposed to be a &quot;discipline-agnostic&quot; piece of software, while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bio-Formats is focused on life sciences file formats.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK. Understood.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  However, LIF should work if you download Fiji, choose Help &gt; Switch to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Modern Mode, and then File &gt; Open your LIF file. This is thanks to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SCIFIO Bio-Formats compatibility component
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/scifio/scifio-bf-compat">https://github.com/scifio/scifio-bf-compat</A>) which is bundled with Fiji.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It does work, but not with File-&gt;Open. It doesn't present the right dialog
</I>&gt;<i> for file import. You can go to File-&gt;Import-&gt;Bio-Formats. When you go to
</I>&gt;<i> file-open (even in modern mode in FiJi), it just imports the first image of
</I>&gt;<i> the bundle with each channel on a separate plane instead of creating a
</I>&gt;<i> composite. It doesn't offer you the choices the way Bio-Formats does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Alternately, you can install Bio-Formats by turning on the Fiji and/or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bio-Formats update sites shown in ImageJ2's Help &gt; Update &quot;Manage Update
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sites&quot; dialog.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; This is just a sample, but there is a bunch more. My prediction is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; that the users will not migrate to the new version if you ship it as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; is. They frankly need a reason to migrate and ImageJ2 is not offering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; them any.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Agreed; &quot;regular users&quot; should not be switching to the new interface
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet. There are too many bugs and not enough advantages.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is why decided to keep the ImageJ2 releases using the 1.x
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface, for the time being. This keeps 100% backwards compatibility
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while also providing many advantages:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    * the ImageJ Updater
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    * the Script Editor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    * user-facing improvements made possible by our ImageJ 1.x patching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mechanism, such as File &gt; Open using the SCIFIO library to read TIFFs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and other formats more robustly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    * new developer-facing APIs (esp.,parameterized modules)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are downsides though:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    * IJ1 UI is limited to XYZCT (though we may later patch in support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for additional dimensions)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    * IJ1 UI cannot handle tiled huge image planes (a feature planned for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the IJ2 UI)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    * Lack of separation of concerns; IJ1 UI is fundamentally tied to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IJ1 data model
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that and the fact that FiJi already has many of these features is
</I>&gt;<i> why I was convinced that ImageJ2 is the modern interface. The data model
</I>&gt;<i> limitation is a serious one, because people cannot just migrate their
</I>&gt;<i> plugins in one fell swoop. Rather, they have to first play with the new
</I>&gt;<i> APIs, then start working on the data model conversion, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * Further reading: <A HREF="http://dev.imagej.net/rationale,">http://dev.imagej.net/rationale,</A>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; Right now ImageJ1 is a mature platform with few bugs and a plethora of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; mostly seamlessly working plugins.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In many ways. But due to ImageJ1's protracted incremental development,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its API how grown organically far beyond its original design goals, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it now contains a plethora of limitations and edge cases.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; The biggest gripe most users have with ImageJ1 is its antiquated UI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With that insight in mind, we recently decided to allow the ImageJ2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Swing UI to begin diverging much more from the ImageJ 1.x design. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be nice to take more liberties and create something that behaves in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way more standardized with other modern applications. See Icy for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inspiration (<A HREF="http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/">http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/</A>).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; and I would wait with the release of the final version until you (we?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; (1) have ironed out all the bugs and inconsistencies,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  From experience, that goal will never occur. The ImageJ2 design
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fundamentally cannot be 100% consistent with ImageJ 1.x. Not even ImageJ
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.x is 100% consistent with previous versions of ImageJ 1.x. And no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software of this magnitude is bug-free, either.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. I may have overstated that goal. It would be a more realistic goal to
</I>&gt;<i> have it bug-free enough that it is not super-annoying to the casual user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; (2) have good end-user documentation so they know how to do things the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; new way,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed, we had a whole milestone dedicated to documentation in our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> original release plan:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://trac.imagej.net/milestone/imagej2-b11-docs">http://trac.imagej.net/milestone/imagej2-b11-docs</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; and (3) have provided users with at least one &quot;killer&quot; feature that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; they have longed for.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Many such &quot;killer&quot; feature ideas were discussed on the ImageJX list when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ImageJ2 was first launched:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Absolutely a killer feature, but I am guessing difficult to implement in a
</I>&gt;<i> plugin-based framework.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know a lot of those are in some sense architectural, but many of them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have huge impact for users, too. Happy to elaborate on any specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aspects of these.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; I think there is one thing that can be done in terms of point (3) that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; will make many users happy is a &quot;pin&quot; button in each image
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; window/dialog. If the &quot;pin&quot; is activated then the window/dialog will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; be brought to the foreground every time the user brings any other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;pinned&quot; window or the main imagej bar to the foreground. This solves
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; the perrenial usability problem of ImageJ1 where if you have multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; images open, you have to hunt for the right image, then hunt for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; brightness/contrast dialog, then hunt for the channels dialog in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; taskbar/dock.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note that there are shortcuts for many of ImageJ's windows, which reduce
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the need to hunt through the taskbar. E.g.: Shift+C for the B&amp;C window,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Shift+Z for channels, Enter for the main ImageJ window.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I've been using those shortcuts, but it is still annoying to have to
</I>&gt;<i> find the image, and then press shift-Z and shift-C every time you switch
</I>&gt;<i> back and forth between applications. Most annoyingly, the ImageJ toolbar
</I>&gt;<i> disappears (is there a shortcut to bring it to foreground???) unless you
</I>&gt;<i> set it always on top, which in turn makes it get in the way of other
</I>&gt;<i> applications. What many users do is switch back and forth between ImageJ
</I>&gt;<i> and other apps that allow them to put figures together
</I>&gt;<i> (Illustrator/Photoshop/PowerPoint/Word) or analyze the data
</I>&gt;<i> (Excel/R/Statistica). Right now I spend half my time fishing for the right
</I>&gt;<i> image/dialog/button.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; I don't think this should be a difficult feature to implement and I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; can try to do that, but I will need time to plow through the codebase
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; and take it all in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This feature could also be implemented for the ImageJ 1.x UI, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would get it into the hands of users more immediately. And you could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easily distribute it via an ImageJ update site; see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.imagej.net/Update_Sites.">http://wiki.imagej.net/Update_Sites.</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good. I'll give it a stab.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; I hope that my comments will help with the development. I am hoping to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; contribute to the actual work soon.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Development of the core ImageJ system is a substantially different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> endeavor from feature ideas like better window management, analysis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plugins, etc. The question is: which sort of project are you more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interested in working on?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I will be interested in features development more than the core,
</I>&gt;<i> but that may change as I get more familiar with the core.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; Please let me know your thoughts. Also, I thought that I might want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; send these comments to you personally rather than to the ImageJ-devel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; list, since I don't want to step on anyones toes. I imagine there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; more to your decision to ship on June 1st than just software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; excellence - things like funding, publications, etc. Please feel free
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; to forward my letter to the imagej-devel list if you think this will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; be constructive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks. As I said before, the imagej-devel list is the best place to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discuss these matters. ImageJ is an open source project, and as such is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> best discussed in public to keep the community informed of the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development directions, invite feedback and constructive criticism from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interested parties, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Got it.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Curtis
