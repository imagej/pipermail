           Product: Fiji
           Version: unspecified
          Hardware: Macintosh
                OS: Mac OS
            Status: NEW
          Severity: minor

         Component: ImageJ2
          Assignee: imagej-devel at imagej.net
          Reporter: glenmac at uw.edu

opened 2 TIFFs, 1392x1040 at 50%, 8-bit unsigned integer
Help>Switch to Modern Mode
selected line tool
drew a short ROI on 1 tiff
Edit>Selection>Properties

the active image duplicated, zoomed to 100%, but remained in a 50% window
Edit>Selection>Properties
error msg about lack of selection
Active image duplicated with original name (no Copy in window title) in a 100%
size window with image displayed at 50% in upper left corner.  
the red button to close the window was inactive, info in toolbar said
?Drawing??
clicked on tool bar and window returned to normal.

I tried it again with the original image
Edit>Selection>Properties
zoomed to 100% in 50% window
Edit>Selection>Properties
zoomed to 100% in 100% window

Closed all images and reloaded the original tiffs,
now Edit>Selection>Properties behaves normally

Opened FIJI
opened TIFF
Help>Switch to Modern Mode
draw line
Edit>Selection>Properties
only strange behavior is that the active image is duplicated in a window with
no information at the top and no LUT across the bottom.  


FIJI will not quit in Modern Mode, but you probably know that.

--- Comment #1 from Johannes Schindelin <johannes.schindelin at gmx.de> ---
Please understand that the modern mode is only a preview at the moment (as I
made quite clear in my announcement mail a couple of months back).

Therefore, I am not surprised that using a legacy plugin interacting with the
modern GUI does not quite work yet... we focus on the image processing plugins
first, and before they work correctly, I will probably put less emphasis on
fixing legacy plugins unrelated to processing images.

And no, the "Fiji won't quit" (unless this is a backhanded comment at our
dedication to keep going with this underfunded project) is not a problem I am
aware of... I thought we had nailed that. Please feel free to file another bug
report for that, with a macro reproducing the error.

As an aside, we decided that "Fiji won't quit" would make a great (and

Hi Will,

Sorry for the delay in reply; I have been busy with the ImageJ OPS
hackathon in Konstanz this past week.
(https://github.com/imagej/imagej-opsif you're interested)

I am CCing the ome-devel and imagej-devel lists in case other developers in
the community are interested in details of the ImageJ/OMERO integration.

> Could you give us an outline of the functionality that you're working
> on - what the stack looks like etc so I can pass this on to them.

On a technical level, the dependency stack is briefly summarized here:
https://github.com/imagej/imagej-omero#set-up-imagej2

You need OMERO 5, Jython available on your path, and ImageJ2 installed into
omero/lib/ImageJ.app, along with the scifio-omero and ij-omero libraries in
the ImageJ.app/jars folder. You can install whatever other plugins you want
into jars/ and plugins/, and any ImageJ scripts you want into scripts/.

There are some loose ends I must finish for ImageJ parameterized scripts to
fully work in OMERO, but I will complete that work as soon I return from
the EU (or maybe even do it while I am visiting Josh later this week).

> - E.g. what will be the requirements of a headless analysis plugin,

The two major rules of thumb are:

1) For it to work headless, do not use java.awt or javax.swing. Technically
you can use certain things, but why? Better to just avoid those packages
all together.

2) For it to be usable, it must declare its inputs and outputs as
parameters (rather than doing something dirty like harvesting them from a
UI, config file, etc.). That way, the integration layer will map them to
OMERO script parameters and they will be fully integrated with OMERO.
Supported parameter types currently are:
- All primitive types and primitive wrappers
- Big numbers
- Dates
- Colors
- Files
- Images

With support to come later for:
- Results tables (https://github.com/imagej/imagej-omero/issues/1)
- ROIs (https://github.com/imagej/imagej-omero/issues/2)

There will also be lots of usability enhancements to do later (e.g.,
https://github.com/imagej/imagej-omero/issues/4) but those are less urgent.

> how parameters are presented to OMERO scripts

OMERO treats each ImageJ module parameter as a script parameter. The
mapping is 1-to-1.

> how ImageJ connects to OMERO

It connects via Ice, of course, using the omero-client library. ImageJ runs
in an separate JVM from OMERO, which is spun up by the system call to
jython.

> what API/gateway does it use etc.

Yes, that is exactly the idea, and it works very well. ImageJ2 uses the
SciJava Common plugin mechanism for extensibility and discovery, so
extensions on the classpath work with zero configuration. And new ImageJ
scripts in the ImageJ.app/scripts subtree are automatically discovered, too.

The only wrinkle there is that the OMERO script wrappers (in
omero/lib/scripts/imagej) must be regenerated by running "genScripts.py"
afterwards. But we can automate that (see
https://github.com/imagej/imagej-omero/issues/5).

Yeah, it would be great to get Alex's work unified with the ImageJ2
integration. It is probably a couple of months early for that, though.
However, I am excited that we now have a solid plan to get ImageJ 2.0.0
released within the next few months. In particular, we are on the cusp of
supporting "mixed world" commands in ImageJ, so that the IJ1 interface can
execute IJ2-style parameterized commands and scripts on ImageJ1 data
structures. Combined with our IJ1 patching to enable headless support, it
will become feasible to expose many IJ1 plugins within OMERO by porting
them to the IJ2 parameterized approach, but without needing to port the
data structures being used.

When that is further along I will provide more documentation so that A)
users can seriously start using ImageJ from within OMERO; and B) developers
can better understand the requirements for ImageJ commands to work headless
from OMERO.

Regards,
Curtis

I do not see an ImageIcon call on line 74:

https://github.com/ad1054/Postcards/blob/master/src/main/java/PostCard.java#L74

This suggests that your repository is desynchronized with your local code.

In any case, it looks as if the getClass().getResource("/English.jpg")
call returns null. So the best idea would be to add a debug statement
(i.e. a System.err.println()) to show what
getClass().getResource("/PostCard.class") returns; You can then deduce
where the English.jpg is expected to be (but cannot be found).

Ciao,
Johannes

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] (headless) command execution
Message-ID: <20140313093909.GC25772@informatik.uni-halle.de>

Hi Curtis, hi Johannes,

we have a few questions regarding commands and command execution
to wrap them for our graphical editor and also command line execution
of operators resp. commands.

What are the precoditions assumed when running a (headless) command

  o may the command assume that its initializer, if any, has been executed prior to executing its run-Method?

  o may the initializer-Method assume some of the parameter of the command already set
    (as e.g. a single ImageDisplay), and of course, which parameters?

    as an example, the DuplicateImage command adds input parameters to itself
    in its initializer-method depending on the inputDisplay.
    Thus is seems that DuplicateImage requires, that inputDisplay is set prior to
    calling its initializer and that the user is asked for further parameters lateron.

  o more generally, are there parameters of commands set by the standard ij2 preprocessos
    besides a single unresolved Dataset?
    And is there an easy way to figure out
    what preprocessors are run in which order in the standard ij2 context?

- What is your concept to run a headless command from command line (or shell script), which
  adds input parameters dependent on the value of other input parameters?

  Do you encourcage to dynamically add input parameters to commands?

- Is there (still) a static method to get hold of the context, as a while ago was
  possible via ImageJ.getContext() in order not to (very) often create a new
  context (or it the context impemented as a singelton)?
  And how does this work out if running command "truely" headless that is
  from command line without ij2 GUI?

- is it remnants, that some ContextCommands have services as parameters
  as they - if I understand correctly - could retrievee the services from their contex?

- has ij2 already support to execute a headless command from the command line or shell script

Thanks a lot and cheers

Stefan

joda-time should already be a transitive dependency, the problem is that
jruby shadows it (in an incompatible version). We now use jruby-complete
in a newer version (that probably includes a new joda-time). This is good
enough for now, but of course it might break again...

Thx, Dscho, that works for me now - also taught me how to use Maven
dependency management to pick the right JRuby.

Hi Carn?,

I am no longer working with the lab that worked with Antti. I have looked
at the backups I made when I left and I do not have a copy of Antti's work.
Some people in my old lab might have it and they check this mailing list.
However I have also CCed Gabriel Landini (affiliated with Fiji) as he
worked with me on this a bit and may have made a copy of the code.

Hi all,
I think I'm suffering from the problem addressed by commit
c078b33fd<https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/commit/c078b33fd290fd552f2adeb2bccbe8e0d284d963>to
scijava-common. On the Mac, CellProfiler is compiling annotations at
runtime after having moved the Jar files from their original location - I
don't know if that's the problem, but the upshot is that the indexing
process fails when I try to create a context.

I'm using the POMs for the Beta7.7 release and was hoping I could pick up
scijava-common 2.11.0 in order to get that patch, but
8ab5f0db<https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/commit/8ab5f9db5740c8f6debc78334a3aec7be51a2adb>
changes
the interface to Contextual, so oil and water don't mix for now. Any
suggestions? I'm thinking of cherrypicking c078b33fd to scijava-common 2.9
and including the resulting EclipseHelper in my own JAR that will get
loaded ahead of scijava-common.jar.

Offending CellProfiler console output below...

[ECLIPSE HELPER] Indexing annotations...
Warning: could not load class 'jars.JavaScript.JavaScript'
(jars/JavaScript/JavaScript (wrong name: JavaScript)); skipping
Warning: could not load class
'jars.JavaScript.org.mozilla.classfile.ByteCode'

... more of same...

Thx in advance,

I chatted this over with Curtis and we came to the conclusion that it
would be best to just release another intermediate beta, 2.0.0-beta-7.8. I
am in the process of doing that now.

Message-ID: <CAPOrs_2CNBQ2-XeTVUY==3dfk1ne0bK+RKfnoYfdAa78wck+Gg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Barry

early last year you have contacted Antti Niemist? about his HistThresh
toolbox [1]. This was a Matlab toolbox for image thresholding which he
released under GPLv2+. In the mailing list, he agreed to release it
under BSD for ImageJ2 development.

Unfortunately, it appears that he no longer works at the Tampere
University of Technology and the website for the project has been
taken down. His previous email address has also been cancelled and I
couldn't find his new contact. I tried to use wayback machine to
salvage his project, but the last backup [2] was before the last
release (he made one release prompted by your email which fixed a
couple of bugs in the minimum and maximum likelihood method). I have
made a github repository with the version I found [3]

I made an Octave port which works fine for me [4] but I know some
Matlab users who would like to use it. Would you happen to have made a
backup of the last release he made?

Thanks in advance,
Carn?

Hi Barry, Carn?,
This is the only version I have of the maximum likelihood estimator 
(th_maxlik.m) code from Anti's website. The date of the file in my computer is 
2/Nov/2004.
His method uses the th_minimum.m procedure as a first approximation, which in 
turn uses the bimodtest.m and others (also attached), but in my endeavours of 
porting the th_maxlik method in Java for IJ I failed miserably in reproducing 
the results that the code gave for matlab (shown in the pdf attached).
I spent some time with this particular method trying to resolve what was the 
issue, but I never succeeded, so rather than having a broken method, I left it 
our from the autothreshold plugin.

I hope it is useful.

Regards

Gabriel

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HistThresh toolbox contains selected histogram-based thresholding
algorithms for MATLAB. The toolbox has been tested with MATLAB 6.5
(R13), but it may work with some older versions of MATLAB as well.


CURRENT VERSION
---------------

v1.02 (2 Nov 2004)
- minor update: fixed the perpetual loop bug in th_minimum.m and
  th_intermodes.m


INSTALLATION
------------

Extract the contents of the zip file "HistThresh.zip" into a directory
from which MATLAB can find the m-files.


GETTING STARTED
---------------

The thresholding algorithms are named with the prefix "th_". For
example, "th_minimum.m" is the function for the algorithm by Prewitt
and Mendelsohn that chooses the threshold to be in the valley of a
bimodal histogram. The threshold for an 8-bit image can be found by
typing "T = th_minimum(I)". Further help can be obtained by typing
"help <m-file>" in MATLAB, where "<m-file>" is replaced by the name of
an m-file.

It's done... ;-) Just update your dependencies to use imagej.version
2.0.0-beta-7.8. Or do you use the version as specified in pom-scijava?

So far, I use a version in my own POM to keep things from shifting when I
don't expect them to. At some point, I might let it float with the
snapshots and fix it to a particular release when I tag, but not yet.

Well, if you use pom-scijava, you only need one such number. In the
current case, that would be 1.150, just released, including the bump to
the new ImageJ release.

We are happy to announce a new version of TrackMate, our Fiji plugin for 
your everyday tracking problems.

The full list of changes is listed here: 
http://fiji.sc/2014-03-19_-_TrackMate_v2.2.0_released and here are some 
highlights:

Version 2.2.0 focuses mainly on extendability, tracking performance and 
detection accuracy.

  * Major*improvement for tracking performance*: The LAP trackers are
    now based on theJonker-Volgenant
    <http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02278710>solver, which
    performs better than the Munkres-Kuhn we were using until then. Our
    initial tests report that this new version runs 2x to 4x faster.

  * A*major problem was found in the LoG detector*: Because of a severe
    rounding error, the LoG detector was not behaving as a true LoG
    detector, which strongly hindered its accuracy and potence. The
    problem is now fixed and*the accuracy of the detector has vastly
    improved*. You should now observe much better results when using
    this detector: less spurious spots, better spot size sensitivity,
    better sensitivity to faint spots. On its side, the DoG detector now
    handles spots that lie on the border of the images better. Of
    course, the results will be different when comparing to v2.1.1.

  * We also took the chance to rewrite all the detectors from scratch,
    using the latest development inImgLib2 <http://fiji.sc/ImgLib2>.
    This prompted*major performance improvement for the detection process*.

  * Complete rewrite of the way we handle modules in TrackMate.
    TrackMate now usesSciJava <http://www.scijava.org/>and exploit its
    automatic discovery mechanism for modules. Practically,*it is now
    very easy to extend TrackMate*, and you do not depend on us anymore
    at all for anything. We could completely disappear and you would
    still be able to extend TrackMate so that it suits your need,
    without requiring any of our help. Severaltutorials
    <http://fiji.sc/TrackMate#For_developers_2>describe how to do this.
    This is made possible thanks to the enormous efforts of the SciJava
    team. Thanks to them!


We are very grateful for the user feedback we received, and for the 
courageous users that tested and reported problems during the RC phase. 
We hope you find the tool useful. We hope you find the tool useful for 
you research and welcome your feedback on these channels.

Enjoy!
Johannes & JY

Dear Jean-Yves,

> We are happy to announce a new version of TrackMate, our Fiji plugin for your everyday tracking problems. 

I stumbled around TrackMate a few days ago and was very impressed.  It worked remarkably well for tracking single molecules, and I liked the very logical setup of the plugin.  Thanks to all who worked on this!

Best.

Nico

Hi Stefan,

Apologies for the delay in reply. Just wanted to let you know that we are
not ignoring you -- the timing was just rough because we recently returned
from an intense hackathon (see https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops if
interested) and are still catching up on the backlog. I will make an effort
to reply to your questions within the next few days.

Regards,
Curtis

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Does IterableInterval cover all coordinates?
Message-ID: <CA+B=mGpCPiwnBa97bOGK9+VFmgsT2Ppoc7OXYtojUB_=wqCf5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all (especially ImgLib2 developers)

 I was wondering if it's the intent that
IterableInterval<https://github.com/imglib/imglib/blob/imglib2-2.0.0-beta-25/core/src/main/java/net/imglib2/IterableInterval.java>necessarily
contains ALL integer coordinates within the interval, or are
gaps allowable?

 Either way, could we clarify this in the javadoc?

 I have the need for an iterable interval implementation that allows
arbitrary ordering and sparseness in the integers covered by the interval,
so I wanted to know if it was appropriate to extend IterableInterval or not.

Thanks!

Subject: [ImageJ-devel] Module structure for OPS, and support for scripting
Message-ID: <CADN69y=82bwg2hAFufmR4amJ2fn6jXbaibrZ9stp===qFXaq5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi OPS developers,

Recently -- partially to help with debugging and partially because I think
it would be awesome -- I have been dabbling at implementing an "OPS
interactive interpreter" of some kind. This way, people can type in OPS
commands in an interactive way and play with stuff very easily without
needing an IDE. This would be even better than the ImageJ Script Editor
because it would give immediate feedback.

In the course of investigating this, a number of scripting-related issues
occur to me:

1) It would make most sense to use an existing script language, probably
Jython, since it has the easiest syntax IMO.

2) But it would also be nice if ultimately the interpreter were script
language agnostic, rather than tied to e.g. Jython only.

3) I couldn't find an existing project that provides a JSR-223-based script
interpreter, but I did find a starting point at:
http://stackoverflow.com/a/5598207

4) We are ultimately interested in adding more JSR-223-based scripting
languages to ImageJ -- maybe even more generally than ImageJ to the SciJava
namespace. There is an old project on dev.java.net (mirrored here:
http://fiji.sc/git/?p=scripting/.git;a=summary) that would serve as an
excellent starting point for that.

5) Right now we are implementing each scripting language as its own module
in its own Git repository; see:
https://github.com/imagej/imagej-scripting-scala,
https://github.com/imagej/imagej-scripting-r. I expect many more of these
will arise in the future as we support more languages.

So, how does that relate to OPS? Well, there is this open question of "what
should be part of ImageJ, and what should be part of SciJava?" We touched
on this in Konstanz but didn't really discuss.

The intuition that appeals to me is: if it is image-specific, it is part of
ImageJ. And if it is more general, it lives in SciJava. I like this
approach a lot because I think that in the long term, it will encourage a
larger developer community around the more general projects. (For example:
if all the scripting languages are branded as "ImageJ" then people not
interested in image processing may discard them out of hand when quickly
searching for solutions. SciJava strikes me as a much better level to focus
the scripting language projects.)

If you also agree with this intuition, then we might consider changes like
the following:

* scijava-ops -> scijava-ops-OLD (or moved to "old-master" topic branch)
  -- preserve previous effort until all code has been successfully migrated
out

* imagej-ops core framework -> scijava-ops
  -- the core framework is not image specific

* ij-core module framework -> migrate into scijava-ops
  -- that framework includes modules, commands, displays and widgets
  -- Christian asked me: why not move ij-core's module framework into
scijava-common?
  -- I strongly considered that, but instead I think it fits perfectly into
the OPS framework

* imagej-ops image processing ops -> stay in imagej-ops
  -- these ops are image-specific, and depend on ImgLib2

* imagej-ops widgets -> stay in imagej-ops
  -- and move Swing-specific code into ij-ui-swing

* ij-core scripting framework -> scijava-scripting
  -- scripting support is not image-specific

* ij-scripting-* -> scijava-scripting-*
  -- each of these has different, often very large, dependencies

* other ij-core unrelated stuff -> think more; consider case-by-case
  -- maybe some goes to scijava-common...
  -- would be nice if the "ij-core" module could completely go away

I know that such changes would rock the boat... again. But before we get
too much farther along I would like to have a very clear, sensible policy
which answers the question: "What is SciJava, and what is ImageJ?" And I
think the structure above would do that, and be a really strong foundation
for the next decade at least.

What do you think? I am confident I could complete much of that
restructuring very quickly (in 1-2 days).

Regards,
Curtis

I would like to do that anyway.

How about doing that later? There is no need to stress ourselves out about
it; we can easily do that anytime.

I agree, but I would suggest doing that later, too.

That makes absolute sense (as the above), but I would like to focus on
using ij-ops first. Traditionally, it has been much easier to develop a
fast-moving project when it is maintained in a single repository.

> * imagej-ops widgets -> stay in imagej-ops
>   -- and move Swing-specific code into ij-ui-swing

I guess that probably needs to happen sooner rather than later because the
technical debt incurred by mixing UI with processing can be a huge pain in
the back side.

I agree that this is a good plan, but again, I would love to see this
happening later. Preferably after switching Fiji to the ImageJ2 script
editor because I see a couple of architectural questions looming for us;
These architectural issues are much easier solved when all involved code
lives in the same repository.

Whoa. Radical food for thought. But I begin to see your reasoning and to
agree.

Makes sense. How about revisiting the split in two weeks? We could even
call it milestone 0.2.0.
