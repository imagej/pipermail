<PRE>Hi Graeme,

Based on the list that you &amp; Ilan sent me a while back, I started a
spreadsheet detailing priority targets for support within OMERO:

<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ancmne1B9NOwdGxQOEpKSVVGbk1TQ1ZSMHEzWHFwbmc&amp;usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ancmne1B9NOwdGxQOEpKSVVGbk1TQ1ZSMHEzWHFwbmc&amp;usp=sharing</A>

Anyone is free to check it out and comment if desired. Some of the items on
your list were quite general, and/or not totally clear to me, so edit away
as needed.

&gt;<i> my questions were motivated by the desire to write plugins for IJ1
</I>&gt;<i> that will not be obsolete in IJ2, and preferably be able to be run
</I>&gt;<i> headlessly, e.g. from OMERO.
</I>
OK, thanks for clarifying.

&gt;<i> It seems that ImageJ2 also uses a run method as the entry point for
</I>&gt;<i> running a command? (correct me if I am wrong) In that case, at least
</I>&gt;<i> the run method would have to be replaced.
</I>
ImageJ2's commands use Runnable's run(). ImageJ1 plugins use a custom
PlugIn interface's run(String). So they are technically compatible, though
I wouldn't necessarily recommend creating a hybrid. ;-)

&gt;<i> I was not so worried about ImageJ1's dialogs (which I expected would
</I>&gt;<i> *not* be OK in a headless plugin)
</I>
Actually, confusingly, you *can* use GenericDialog when running headless in
a macro because of the javassist hacks I mentioned. When running from a
macro, the dialog is never actually shown, but instead parameters are
harvested from the macro options string.

&gt;<i> It sounds as though converting IJ1 plugins to use the IJ2 API is
</I>&gt;<i> likely be more productive than trying to use the legacy IJ1 API from
</I>&gt;<i> an IJ2 plugin (headless), but is the latter already known to be
</I>&gt;<i> hopeless? If not, I might be tempted to try a little.
</I>
I wouldn't say hopeless. In many cases, you *can* run IJ1 plugins headless,
as explained on the Fiji wiki Headless page I linked before (
<A HREF="http://fiji.sc/Headless">http://fiji.sc/Headless</A>). My next step for the OMERO integration will be
create an ImageJ2 command &quot;Run Script&quot; which executes a given script or IJ1
macro. Then I can start testing calling IJ1 macro code headless from OMERO
and see how well it works in practice.

That said, I stand by my suggestion that *new* code would be better written
as an ImageJ2 command because otherwise it won't be easily accessible from
the growing number of contexts I mentioned such as CellProfiler and KNIME.

&gt;<i> Until now I have chosen to write for IJ1 since the IJ2 API is still a
</I>&gt;<i> moving target and has a smaller user base, but I guess IJ2 / ImgLib2
</I>&gt;<i> already makes a lot of  sense for headless processing tasks. Would you
</I>&gt;<i> say that once imagej2-b9-rois is out, the IJ2 API will be fairly
</I>&gt;<i> stable going forward?
</I>
My promise is that when ImageJ 2.0.0 final is released, *then* the API will
be stable, with old API being properly deprecated for long periods of time,
etc. Before that, I do not want to make any promises. The API is growing
more and more stable with each release, but it is tough to say what &quot;fairly
stable&quot; really means here.

One idea I had recently is to start bringing some components of ImageJ2 out
of beta in phases. The scijava-common component is already out of beta.
Some IJ2 components such as ij-core are already extremely stable. The
scifio library will probably be out of beta (and hence stable) within a
year. But the hard stuff remains: the ij-data component, how it ties in to
ImgLib2 (which also needs to come out of beta at some point), and the IJ2
display model. Those may need to bake a little longer.

Regards,
Curtis

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Sorry for the delay in reply. Writing to a public mailing list is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better. I am CCing imagej-devel and ome-devel since your questions are very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technical, and related to those two projects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; I thought I would Email you directly because the ImageJ-devel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; mailing list seems to be intended for core project development.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  From <A HREF="http://developer.imagej.net/mailing-lists:">http://developer.imagej.net/mailing-lists:</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; ImageJ: For general user and developer discussion about ImageJ. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; list is the best place to go for help with your specific use case.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ImageJ-devel: For technical and developer discussion of the ImageJ2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; project. This list is for programmers contributing code to ImageJ2, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; interested in technical discussions surrounding such development.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Both are public mailing lists intended for use by the community, not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just for core project development. The wording of ImageJ-devel is phrased
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that way because ImageJ2 is still in beta and if you are using it for your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects, you are an early adopter who is almost certainly &quot;interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technical discussions&quot; surrounding core development.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; 1. I was looking for example plugins (&amp; example minimal plugin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; project), but get 404's when I try to look at the HelloWorld and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; GradientImage examples here:-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://developer.imagej.net/writing-imagej2-plugins">http://developer.imagej.net/writing-imagej2-plugins</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (I found the github repo &amp; Fiji wiki ImgLib2 examples)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  All links on that page should be working again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; 2. I see an example of calling IJ2 from a legacy plugin, but am also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; interested in doing the reverse, and unsure what the limitations are.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  The limitations are evolving. Legacy support is very challenging to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right. That said, it should work to call ImageJ1 data structures from an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ImageJ2 style command. There is a LegacyService for converting between IJ1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and IJ2 data structures, although the API still needs work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Note that at the moment, ImageJ2 commands are only discovered and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exposed in the modern ImageJ2 UI. We are exploring ways of blending things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in additional ways, such as allowing the ImageJ1/Fiji legacy UI to discover
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and allow execution of IJ2 commands.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  What is your goal? You want to write a plugin that is available from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both IJ1 and IJ2? If so, structuring it as a legacy IJ1 plugin (which may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or may not leverage certain IJ2 API internally as demonstrated in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> calling-modern-from-legacy) is the way to go for now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; 3. What are the constraints / requirements for running plugins
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (including legacy wrapped in IJ2?) headless, with a view to running
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; from OMERO in future?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  In IJ2 terms, the ImgLib2 library is fully usable headless. If your IJ2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> command does not depend on ij-ui you probably will be able to run it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> headlessly. The requirements, in general, are the same as running any Java
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code headless: do not use AWT or Swing or other UI, especially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows/Frames/Dialogs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Unfortunately, you cannot just take a legacy IJ1 plugin and &quot;wrap in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IJ2.&quot; The problem is that fundamentally, IJ1 is filled with java.awt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> references including some core classes extending java.awt.Dialog and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> java.awt.Frame, which are illegal to even instantiate headlessly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  We have some crazy hacks in Fiji to allow limited execution of IJ2 code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> headless even when it would normally use those AWT window classes. It works
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by using bytecode manipulation (javassist library) to rewrite parts of IJ1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at runtime to avoid references to those classes. However, in some cases
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things will still blow up. It should go without saying that any time an IJ1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plugin asks the user for input (e.g., the WaitForUserInput dialog), it will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fail when trying to run headless.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  All of that said, we may be able to support calling many IJ1 plugins
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> headlessly from OMERO in the same way we support it headlessly in general:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using by install Xvfb on the server side. This gets around the limitations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of java.awt.headless=true, in favor of actually giving Java a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> virtual/offscreen UI. See: <A HREF="http://fiji.sc/Headless">http://fiji.sc/Headless</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  As of this writing, I have not yet tried to get legacy IJ1 plugins
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working from OMERO. The reason is that I know it will be a lot of effort,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for something that would only be transitional. We are writing IJ2 precisely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to avoid the sorts of problems incurred by IJ1's heavy use of AWT in core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> classes. IJ2 maintains a strict separation of concerns, and its commands
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have typed inputs and outputs, which are a natural match to other paradigms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such as OMERO scripts, CellProfiler modules, and KNIME nodes. Mapping IJ1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plugins to those paradigms is difficult not only due to headless issues but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also because in general there is no easy way to know the actual inputs and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outputs of the plugin, since IJ1 plugins do not declare that metadata.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  So in conclusion, while I sympathize with the desire to execute ImageJ1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plugins from OMERO, ultimately a better direction is to rewrite plugins of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interest as ImageJ2 commands so we truly get a &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effect with the whole software ecosystem interoperating with ImageJ2.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; Apologies if I missed some documentation, or a more appropriate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; community forum to ask these questions, and me know if I am jumping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the gun and would be better waiting a few months.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Not at all; these are good questions and not well explained online. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> added a couple of short entries to the online FAQ:
