Hi Johannes,

This looks very intereresting.  Do you think this could replace the
existing use of JACE to provide C++ bindings, or would we still require
something like JACE to provide all the bindings/entry points into the
Avian VM?  I assume you will still need C++ headers/wrapper proxies
generating somehow?

On a related note, over the last few weeks, the first parts of the
native Bio-Formats C++ implementation have been staged.  This includes
shared libraries for the OME-XML data model and bioformats, though more
work is pending review; it's not yet complete.  In terms of the work
done, this includes all the basic infrastructure (cmake, platform
compatibility code), generated data model, and base model
interfaces/classes.  The metadata store classes are pending, and once
those are done we'll have all the needed bits for native
OME-XML/OME-TIFF reading and writing.

It may be the case that something like the Avian VM would be very useful
in providing support for readers and writers which do not have a native
C++ implementation.


Regards,
Roger
