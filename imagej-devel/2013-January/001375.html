<PRE>Hi Aivar,

some months ago we had a similar discussion with Barry and Curtis (see 
below). Sorry for not posting this on the mailing list.
 From our (KNIME) point of view, an algorithm, which is implemented in 
ImgLib2, shouldn't know about any Axes / Axes Names.
The algorithm just knows on which number of dimensions (2-d, 3-d, ... 
n-D)  it could run. ImgLib2 Views can be used to pre-process the 
algorithm input (e.g. 2D Slices of an 3-D Img).
For Example: You have a 4-dimensional Image and you want to process it 
plane-wise (2D, also possible in 3-D ... n-D just in the example: 2D). 
In KNIME we use a Component called &quot;Dim Selection&quot; in the GUI where a 
user selects e.g. X and Y to define the planes of interest. All other 
dimensions are used to iterate over the x-y-planes (e.g. if t=2, c=3 
then we iterate over 6 x-y-planes). After we determined the indices of 
the X-Y Axes of our incoming Image (using the Axes in ImgPlus) we 
internally create several (nested) ImgLib2 Views using Views.interval, 
Views.translate etc pp. The resulting views are passed to the algorithm 
as a RandomAccessible, RandomAccessibleInterval or (if necessary) an 
ImgView/ImgPlusView (wrapping a RandomAccessibleInterval).

Using Views we don't restrict the algorithms such that they only work on 
dedicated dimensions. In fact, any user-selection of dimensions can be 
used to create a View (as long as the algorithms can handle the number 
of dimensions of the resulting view). We suggested a general &quot;Dimension 
Selection&quot; Service for ImageJ2, but unfortunately we didn't find the 
time yet to implement it.

Looking forward for replies ;)

Martin, Michael Z. and Christian

Hi Barry,

maybe my last Mail was a bit hasty and we reordered our thoughts a bit
;o) Sorry for that. So forget about the part of &quot;processing very large
image objects&quot;. But the comments on the Normalize plugin (or rather the
Auto Contrast plugins) are still true. To be clear, let me explain
again, what we wanted to address by means of the &quot;AutoContrast&quot;-plugin:

The AutoContrast plugin first calculates a histogram and then applies a
normalization function determined from the histogram to each pixel. Now,
this histogram, e.g. can be determined on various pixel-(sub)sets of the
image in a n-dimensional image object: one can calculate the histogram
for all pixels, one do it for each XY-plane individually, one can to it
for each XT-plane (if T existent), one can do it for each XYC-cube, if
we consider a 5-dim image with XYCT, and so on (the same is true, e.g.
for Thresholding, CCA, ... . Hence, there are various way how to handle
n-dim data properly (depending on the algorithm itself, whether it can
handle only 2D, 3D or nD data). Certainly, one can define that each
plugin has to care about how to handle nD data in a appropriate way by
itself. Thats fine, actually. But what would be desirable is maybe the
existence of some convenience-tools to simplify the n-D data handling
(e.g. think of a service which ask the user to select the dimensions to
operate on and whose to iterate; or maybe a component in a dialog and
some helper classes, ...). This would for example make the
AutoContrast-implementation more general and hardcoded things like
&quot;axes.getLabel()==&quot;Channel&quot; (line207) (the user decides, what a channel
is) or the question &quot;how to handle RGB images&quot; (line 156) would be
lapsed. Currently the AutoContrast-plugin only processes a nD-image on
the whole.

Maybe we can give you an example how we handle it (which is certainly
not perfect, but illustrates the idea somehow):

Given: Image in 5D (XYCZT).
Let's assume an algorithm is applicable only in 2D (Maybe find edges) or
the results differ if we use 2D or 3D representation of an image
(AutoContrast, Thresholding etc), as mentioned above.
In any case the user may select what his process planes are by selecting
the labels of this planes (e.g. XY, XT, XC, CT, etc., could also be a
N-Dimensional selection, depending on the algorithm). The algorithm then
is applied to any selected plane separately. This is possible as we use
the Operation concept which we defined together with you guys in
Dresden. For the given 5d input we create a proper output (e.g. a 5D
BitType image in the case of Thresholding) and then we create several
views depending on the dimension selection of the user on the input and
the output. The algorithm is called as we provide it as well the input
as the output container before hands. Remember we do not duplicate
memory or something as we use Views on the input and output data (e.g.
one plane).


We hope, we could express ourself more clear.

Thanks a lot!

Best,

Christian and Martin

*Subject: **[ImageJ-devel] ImgLib2 dimensionality*
*Date: *January 10, 2013 10:26:06 PM GMT+01:00
*To: *<A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-devel">imagej-devel at imagej.net</A> &lt;mailto:<A HREF="http://imagej.net/mailman/listinfo/imagej-devel">imagej-devel at imagej.net</A>&gt;

I was looking at the dimensional code in net.imglib2.meta.Axes. This is 
an enum of known, named AxisTypes such as X, Y, Z..., has the capacity 
for CustomAxisTypes, and some sort of characterization of these 
dimensions with 'isXY()' and 'isSpatial()'.  (Perhaps we could replace 
these latter with some kind of EnumSet of DimensionTypes, such as XY, 
SPATIAL, etc. for the discussion that follows.)

It might be useful to have a concept of a COINCIDENTAL type.  This sort 
of dimension represents different aspects of the same pixel/voxel/doxel. 
  It's as if you look at it with red glasses, blue glasses, etc. 
  Effectively this is the same as non-spatial/-temporal since all of the 
default AxisTypes besides XYZT would be coincidental.  But with this you 
can specify if a new CustomAxisType should be coincidental or not.  For 
example, if you wrote a plugin that works on an image in 5D that is a 
series of 4D (XYZT) images, the dimension that represents the series of 
images is not coincidental (and not spatial or temporal either).

Another useful concept would be whether a dimension is DISCRETE (or 
NON_INTERPOLABLE?).   This sort of image would be analogous to a table 
of height/weight/shoe size per individual (pixel).  This works only 
because it happens you can express all three measurements as floating 
point.  Anyway, the point is these measurements are totally independent, 
the order is arbitrary, and it never would make any sense to combine 
them somehow or interpolate between them.  I've been working on a FLIM 
fitting plugin and using such images as my output, where the 
measurements are a set of fitted lifetime parameters, for example A1, 
T1, A2, T2, Z, all doubles.  It's the equivalent of five separate images 
in one and could just be refactored as such. [*]

My motivating concern was that if were to introduce such a DISCRETE 
DimensionType most existing plugins or algorithms will not do anything 
useful (other than simple things like copying, etc.).  In fact they will 
most likely clobber my discrete dimension.

What if an algorithm could somehow declare via annotation what sorts of 
dimensions it was interested in?  Without such an annotation the default 
would be to get all of the non-discrete dimensions, and the caller 
splits the image into sub images across discrete dimensions and 
processes them successively.  Then existing algorithms could do useful 
work on my discrete image.  Other algorithms that understand the meaning 
of this discrete dimension information could declare an interest in it 
and get the whole thing.

This could be a very useful mechanism in other instances.  In general 
lets say an algorithm could specify dimension types or specific 
dimensions of interest and the caller splits the image into sub images 
across the remaining dimensions.  Then the algorithm gets a cursor that 
iterates only on the dimensions of interest.  They could set the cursor 
position within these dimensions or just iterate through the whole thing.

Another use case might be to split up arbitrary images into XY slices 
for 2D-processing algorithms. On the input side, my FLIM fitting 
algorithm could declare an interest in the LIFETIME AxisType only and 
get called pixel by pixel with a lifetime dimension cursor to process a 
whole image that has unknown dimensions.

For another example, the early ImgLib1 sample Floyd-Steinberg dithering 
algorithm could process only non-COINCIDENTAL dimensions. This would 
avoid distributing errors from the red channel to the blue channel, for 
instance; they would be dithered one by one.

Hope this makes sense!  There's a lot of hand-waving here at present, 
particularly how this dimensional interest would be specified.

Thanks for reading,

Aivar Grislis

([*] Another alternative would be my creating a custom 
FittedLifetimeType or some kind of generic TupleType)
