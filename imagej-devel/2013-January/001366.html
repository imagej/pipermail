<PRE>Hi Gerrit,

The ImageJ and ImageJ-devel lists are pleasant lists, no need to apologize
for asking questions that were not answered well enough at the conference.

&gt;<i> 1- what does the pom version mean, and which version should I use, I
</I>&gt;<i> found different numbers in the examples.
</I>
If I understand correctly, you are referring to the version number here:

<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/minimal-ij1-plugin/blob/master/pom.xml#L16">https://github.com/imagej/minimal-ij1-plugin/blob/master/pom.xml#L16</A>

The idea of Maven is that every project comes in a specific version. For
example, you might want to release your plugin as version 0.1.0 or 1.0.0.
Leading up to that version, you would probably label it as 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
or 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT to indicate that this is an intermediate revision
leading up to said version.

So it is your choice what version number to use ;-)

&gt;<i> 2- how is the imagej version determined
</I>&gt;<i> (&lt;version&gt;${imagej1.version}&lt;/version&gt;) ?
</I>
It is defined in the SciJava POM, as a version range:

<A HREF="https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/blob/master/pom-scijava/pom.xml#L21">https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/blob/master/pom-scijava/pom.xml#L21</A>

Basically, it says: every version from 1.45s on is good enough for us.

If it is actually not good enough for your project, e.g. because you
require a feature Wayne introduced in, say, 1.47b, you need to override
that setting in your pom.xml in the properties section:

	&lt;properties&gt;
		&lt;imagej1.version&gt;1.47b&lt;/imagej1.version&gt;
	&lt;/properties&gt;

You could also decide that a version range [1.47b,) is preferable, of
course.

&gt;<i> 3- During build I see the following message: Property
</I>&gt;<i> 'imagej.app.directory' unset; Skipping copy-jars
</I>&gt;<i> So it must be possible to place the jar into my own imagej installation,
</I>&gt;<i> how?
</I>
You can set the property either in the &lt;properties&gt; section of your
pom.xml as described for imagej1.version above, or via the command-line.
Probably Netbeans lets you define that, too, but since I am not using
Netbeans myself, I cannot tell you how, sorry!

&gt;<i> 4- During run an imagej jar from ~/.m2.... is started, is this only for
</I>&gt;<i> test/debug? how to use my own imagej?
</I>
This is only used to compile your .jar file. If you set the
imagej.app.directory property properly, it will actually be copied into
the jars/ subdirectory of the location you pointed the property to.

&gt;<i> 5- The process_pixels application does not quit properly, I have to stop
</I>&gt;<i> it from netbeans.
</I>
Sorry, do you have more information about that? I do not understand the
issue.

&gt;<i> 6- My software is dependent from other plugins, such as particle8 from
</I>&gt;<i> Gabriel Landini's Morphology, can/is this incorporated in the imagej
</I>&gt;<i> maven repository?
</I>
The easiest way to do that would probably to install it locally for the
moment. Please see Maven's console log for details how to do that after
specifying a dependency, e.g.

		&lt;dependency&gt;
			&lt;groupId&gt;uk.ac.bham.dentistry&lt;/groupId&gt;
			&lt;artifactId&gt;Particles8_&lt;/artifactId&gt;
			&lt;version&gt;1.6&lt;/version&gt;
		&lt;/dependency&gt;

(I took the version number from the web site, and constructed the groupId
from the web site, too. Note that you will need to wrap the .class files
in a .jar file before installing it locally.)

&gt;<i> 7- In my ant script I'm using a call to svnversion, in order to place
</I>&gt;<i> the latest build number and date in the about box. Can this be done in
</I>&gt;<i> maven?
</I>
The way this is done in Maven is by using the buildnumber plugin. This
will put the current revision into the MANIFEST.MF under the tag
'Implementation-Build'.

You probably want to depend on ij-core (groupId net.imagej, version
2.0.0-SNAPSHOT for now) to retrieve that:

<A HREF="http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-daily/javadoc/imagej/util/Manifest.html#getManifest(java.lang.Class">http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-daily/javadoc/imagej/util/Manifest.html#getManifest(java.lang.Class</A>)

and

<A HREF="http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-daily/javadoc/imagej/util/Manifest.html#getImplementationBuild(">http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-daily/javadoc/imagej/util/Manifest.html#getImplementationBuild(</A>)

Ciao,
Johannes
