Where are the links, anyway? In every news article I read in the past two
days about the vulnerability, it was made quite obvious that this is about
applets, some even including instructions how to disable Java applets in
Firefox, Safari, Chrome.

Without anything more specific, I am afraid I cannot help you.

Hth,
Johannes
