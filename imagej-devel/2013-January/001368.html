<PRE>Hi Gerrit,

I was mostly done (except for &quot;...&quot; sections) with a reply to you
yesterday, before needing to leave work for the day. Since then, Johannes
has replied, so my response is now rather redundant. But I am sending it
now anyway to supplement Johannes's reply.


&gt;<i> 1- what does the pom version mean, and which version should I use, I
</I>&gt;<i> found different numbers in the examples.
</I>
The pom.xml of minimal-ij1-plugin inherits from a parent called
pom-scijava. This parent POM defines and configures many things so that the
POMs of individual plugin projects are shorter (i.e., so they don't have to
repeat things).

The version of pom-scijava (1.27 as of this writing) indicates the version
of that parent POM. We occasionally improve the parent POM, adding and
tweaking it. When we do so, its version increases. I suggest leaving the
version that same as what's in minimal-ij1-plugin, since that refers to the
latest version. Future 1.x versions will be backwards compatible, so if you
later notice that we have updated minimal-ij1-plugin to e.g. 1.43, you can
(optionally) update your plugin to that version as well.

The version of minimal-ij1-plugin itself (1.0.0 as of this writing) is the
version of your plugin. This string is appended to the JAR file name (e.g.,
minimal-ij1-plugin-1.0.0.jar), so that you can differentiate between
multiple versions of your plugin. Use whatever versioning scheme you want.

However, once you become more comfortable with Maven, I suggest using a
SNAPSHOT version during development [1], and a release (i.e., non-SNAPSHOT)
version when distributing your plugin. The reason is to avoid two different
JAR files both called &quot;my-plugin-1.2.3&quot; but with different contents. (This
is part of what Maven calls *build reproducibility*.)


&gt;<i> 2- how is the imagej version determined
</I>&gt;<i> (&lt;version&gt;${imagej1.version}&lt;/version&gt;) ?
</I>
The string &quot;${imagej1.version}&quot; is a property that gets replaced with the
actual value. This value is defined in the pom-scijava parent
configuration. Currently the value is &quot;[1.45s,)&quot; which means &quot;the latest
release version you can find equal to or greater than 1.45s.&quot;

Browse the latest pom-scijava at:

<A HREF="https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/blob/master/pom-scijava/pom.xml">https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/blob/master/pom-scijava/pom.xml</A>

Browse the available versions of ImageJ 1.x at:
    <A HREF="http://maven.imagej.net/content/repositories/releases/net/imagej/ij/">http://maven.imagej.net/content/repositories/releases/net/imagej/ij/</A>

As of this writing, 1.47h is the latest available version, so that's the
one Maven will use with your plugin.


&gt;<i> 3- During build I see the following message: Property
</I>&gt;<i> 'imagej.app.directory' unset; Skipping copy-jars
</I>&gt;<i> So it must be possible to place the jar into my own imagej installation,
</I>how?

This is part of the new imagej-maven-plugin (enabled for you by
pom-scijava). As you suspected, it copies your plugin's JAR file to your
ImageJ plugins folder. But you have to specify where:

    mvn -Dimagej.app.directory=/Applications/ImageJ.app

One way to do that in NetBeans is to right-click your project, select
Custom &gt; Goals... which brings up the Run Maven dialog box. Then specify
&quot;install&quot; for the Goals and
&quot;-Dimagej.app.directory=/Applications/ImageJ.app&quot; for the Properties.

I haven't tested this though; the imagej-maven-plugin is very new and we
are still finalizing how it will work. So please proceed with that in mind.


&gt;<i> 4- During run an imagej jar from ~/.m2.... is started, is this only
</I>&gt;<i> for test/debug? how to use my own imagej?
</I>
...


&gt;<i> 5- The process_pixels application does not quit properly, I have to
</I>&gt;<i> stop it from netbeans.
</I>
...


&gt;<i> 6- My software is dependent from other plugins, such as particle8 from
</I>&gt;<i> Gabriel Landini's Morphology, can/is this incorporated in the imagej
</I>&gt;<i> maven repository?
</I>
...


&gt;<i> 7- In my ant script I'm using a call to svnversion, in order to place
</I>&gt;<i> the latest build number and date in the about box. Can this be done in
</I>&gt;<i> maven?
</I>
In general, you can call any needed Ant functionality using the
maven-antrun-plugin [2]. However, for your requirement here, you won't need
it.

The pom-scijava parent uses the buildnumber-maven-plugin to embed the SCM
revision and date in the JAR manifest. You can enable this behavior by
adding the following lines to your POM:

    &lt;plugins&gt;
      &lt;plugin&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;buildnumber-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;/plugin&gt;
    &lt;/plugins&gt;

Then, your About dialog box can access the information from the JAR
manifest using the java.util.jar.Manifest class.

You can see how we use it in ImageJ2 here:

<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imagej/blob/7ffe00ef/core/core/src/main/java/imagej/util/Manifest.java">https://github.com/imagej/imagej/blob/7ffe00ef/core/core/src/main/java/imagej/util/Manifest.java</A>

Or you can use that ImageJ2 Manifest class directly if you are willing to
add a dependency to ij-core to your POM:

    &lt;dependencies&gt;
      &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;${imagej.groupId}&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;ij-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;${imagej.version}&lt;/version&gt;
      &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
