<PRE>Dear John,

This is Kevin Eliceiri, Pi of the GO Grant funding the ImageJDev project. Curtis is right that our current funding is focused on the aims on the page, but I've had several meetings with NIH about additional ways to leverage ImageJ and there is great interest in having additional RFPs down the road that would leverage this great tool and add additional functionality and applications. There are some possibilities of pilot projects too to demonstrate the utility of new applications such as what you propose. I would be happy to discuss this more with you. 

best,
kevin

&gt;<i> Hi John,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Very sorry for the delay in my reply; I have been struggling to catch 
</I>&gt;<i> up on
</I>&gt;<i> email since the ImageJDev announcement. I have CCed the ImageJDev list,
</I>&gt;<i> since other developers may have interest.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My question is this:  Would the scope of the long term interest 
</I>&gt;<i> include a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means that would link up agencies that have funding for developmental
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projects involving ImageJ with possible developers?  In other words, 
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there a means to facilitate requests for proposals (RFPs) to the ImageJ
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community for development of new applications of ImageJ? Or perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something like a centralized technical advisory resource to assist 
</I>&gt;<i> and to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; evaluate the same?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An infrastructure for RFP submission and tracking is a good idea. It 
</I>&gt;<i> is not
</I>&gt;<i> something we proposed in the initial two-year application, but would
</I>&gt;<i> definitely be of interest in the long term, and we would be glad to host
</I>&gt;<i> such a system on the imagejdev.org web site. Do you have any idea what 
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> be entailed, technically, in setting up and maintaining such a centralized
</I>&gt;<i> technical advisory resource?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, in our particular need, ORI is curious whether ImageJ 
</I>&gt;<i> could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applied to searches for specific user defined feature content in a library
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of scientific images (just as a first stage problem), much like what 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does for the face-recognition feature in its iPhoto application.  Obviously,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we could announce this interest and funding availability on our 
</I>&gt;<i> website; but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the first question is what is feasible . . . what we or other possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supporters of new ideas need is access to the technical 
</I>&gt;<i> expertise/advice to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; develop and assess the RFP.  (The ImageJ bulletin board really isn&#8217;t 
</I>&gt;<i> set up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for this purpose, but this approach is one way the former Nanofabrication
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Facility at Cornell worked to assist development.)  Thus new 
</I>&gt;<i> applications in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ImageJ might be also advanced through a centralized place/resource where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requests for proposals involving RFPs for different application appeared
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our funding as of now is largely focused on software engineering, for 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> development of a modular image processing core and next-generation ImageJ
</I>&gt;<i> interface. As such, there will not be a lot of new plugin development
</I>&gt;<i> initially (though we do plan to expand on ImageJ's multidimensional
</I>&gt;<i> visualization capabilities partially via plugins).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing to be aware of is our sister project, Fiji, which has ImageJ
</I>&gt;<i> at its core but focuses on algorithm and plugin development&#8212;the goal 
</I>&gt;<i> is to
</I>&gt;<i> provide a single application that comes bundled with all the plugins
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to do scientific image processing. The Fiji developers are gearing
</I>&gt;<i> up for a proposal to the Google Summer of Code 2010 project (

</I>&gt;<i> immediate option might be to propose your use case for that.
