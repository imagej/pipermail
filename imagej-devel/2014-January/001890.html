<PRE>I would add to this conversation that it would be very useful for other developers to see what Collin has developed in terms of the Fiji launcher script.  I have had situations where I wanted to launch in a custom way not provided by the built-in launcher.  No reason to figure this out if Collin already has.  Collin could label it &quot;experimental&quot; to prevent na&#239;ve users from accidentally using it.  Most of my plugins fall into the &quot;experimental&quot; category anyway-if they didn't I probably wouldn't rely so much on ImageJ.

Hi Johannes,

Thanks for indulging me in this conversation.






Couldn't you say the same thing about Fiji shipping with a .desktop

file?



It does not ship with a .desktop file. It generates it upon startup in

Linux. (To be precise, the ImageJ launcher does.)
That makes more sense, and I should have realized that looking at the executable path in the .desktop file. Maybe I should think about having the scripts generated...





You are welcome to do that, bash scripts are not the way, however. A

better way would be to patch the ImageJ launcher to make it possible to

ship *limited* configuration via update sites that affects the way Fiji is

started.

I can see that making sense in that it's cross platform (since the launcher is cross platform), but I can't see how that would get you any granularity. Meaning I want to start fiji in say 2 ways that would be equivalent to:
ImageJ-launcher -flagA
ImageJ-launcher -flagB
And not overshadow starting with no flags.





So far, I am quite doubtful, however, that such a support is needed. I

might be wrong, but then, I have not been graced with the information

about the intended use case requiring those bash scripts.
Ok, I was trying to keep my questions narrowly focused, but I guess I ended up too vague. This is related to a conversation on the list from this spring (*) about nrrd files and handleExtraFileTypes. I agree that what I'm doing isn't the cleanest/best but I think it's the lesser evil given all the following facts/constraints (and the ones I forgot):

- I need to bypass the standard IJ-io/extraFileTypes/LOCI chain and pass a file arg directly to our plugin. Which is called OpenMIMS (**) btw.

- Architecturally our plugin has gotten a little cluttered over the years and while we're trying to refactor things, I don't have the man power to refactor out our file readers right now.

- Besides myself I would say that all our users use Fiji without starting OpenMIMS &lt;1% of the time. So they don't really want to start Fiji per se.

- I seem to be categorically incapable of keeping even all the Fiji installs in the lab up-to-date/symmetric, let alone those outside the lab, so why not take advantage of the updater?

- Like I mentioned above there are 2 ways (sets of flags) we start our plugin with. So we would need 2 &quot;executables&quot;.

- Our &quot;users demand&quot; a high level of symmetry between at least Linux and OsX in terms of how OpenMIMS/Fiji runs. For example breaking the &quot;one instance of an application&quot; constraint on OsX. And if I have to do crazy things like that, best to have a parallel way of starting Fiji, right? (I know I need more than just a bash script.)

- I'm not stepping on/overshadowing any part of Fiji. Or forcing any of this to be used.

- Even if I make a mess of things or get to the point I can undo this kludge, the updater makes it a lot easier to back out.

So in conclusion, yes I agree that it's not the best but it's probably manageable.

Cheers,
Collin
