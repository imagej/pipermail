<PRE>Hi Jay,

&gt;<i> I typically deploy JEX as a runnable jar via the Eclipse export.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the exported jar fails to run while the Eclipse project
</I>&gt;<i> encounters no such issue. The export process seems to break the IJ2
</I>&gt;<i> portion of the application making it impossible at the moment to
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to deploy the JEX version with the IJ2 enhancements. I've
</I>&gt;<i> isolated the issue to being purely related to the IJ2 set of jars that
</I>&gt;<i> I included into the project.
</I>
This problem is almost certainly due to the fact that the SciJava Common
plugin mechanism stores a file in each JAR at:
/META-INF/json/org.scijava.plugin.Plugin. And when combining multiple JARs
into an uber-JAR, those files need to be aggregated together rather than
overwriting one another. We ran into the very same problem using the
maven-assembly-plugin to build an uber-JAR. Our workaround is here:

<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imagej/blob/imagej-2.0.0-beta-7.6/bin/gen-jar-with-deps.sh">https://github.com/imagej/imagej/blob/imagej-2.0.0-beta-7.6/bin/gen-jar-with-deps.sh</A>

Which calls the AnnotationCombiner class from SciJava Common:
<A HREF="https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/blob/scijava-common-2.9.0/src/main/java/org/scijava/annotations/AnnotationCombiner.java">https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/blob/scijava-common-2.9.0/src/main/java/org/scijava/annotations/AnnotationCombiner.java</A>

In the future we will look into switching to maven-shade-plugin to create
such an uber-JAR.

But I still don't know if/how you can do that with Eclipse's &quot;Export
executable JAR&quot; feature.

&gt;<i> I also noticed that the during the successful eclipse run there is a
</I>&gt;<i> line which reads... [WARNING] Overridden plugin
</I>&gt;<i> ij.plugin.LutLoader(&quot;3-3-2 RGB&quot;) is blacklisted  Do you think there is
</I>&gt;<i> any connection?
</I>
Nope, that warning is unrelated and can be safely ignored.

&gt;<i> I know that Eclipse, when it exports a runnable jar, creates a
</I>&gt;<i> relatively non-standard jar hierarchy (jarinjar), which might be the
</I>&gt;<i> issue
</I>
Hmm, in that case, it may be possible to improve SciJava Common to find
such META-INF in nested JARs. Feel free to file a PR against scijava-common
(<A HREF="https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common">https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common</A>) for this feature if you really
need it.

To pursue that, you'd want to inspect your uber-JAR using the Java JAR
command line tool (e.g., &quot;jar tf myUberJar.jar&quot;) to see exactly what got
put in there. Maybe unpack it (&quot;jar xf myUberJar.jar&quot;) and then examine any
nested JARs, as well.

The relevant code in scijava-common is here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/blob/scijava-common-2.9.0/src/main/java/org/scijava/annotations/Index.java#L130">https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/blob/scijava-common-2.9.0/src/main/java/org/scijava/annotations/Index.java#L130</A>

The code uses ClassLoader.getResources() to access all annotations within
META-INF/json across all JAR files on the classpath. If Eclipse really
embeds JARs inside other JARs, you'd have to smarten up that method to
support that somehow, which would be an unfortunate addition in complexity.

Easier would be to avoid using uber-JARs at all and instead just ship with
all your JAR libraries separately. Then all the annotations will be
discovered as expected.

Or you could somehow run the AnnotationCombiner across all of your JARs
when building your uber-JAR, perhaps using the maven-shade-plugin. If you
structured JEX as a Maven project it would be relatively straightforward to
use that, and do your releases from the command line, too.

Sorry I can't be more helpful, but we really avoid doing things in ways
that cannot be automated from the command line.

Regards,
Curtis

</I>&gt;<i> add the &quot;static{DefaultLegacyService.preinit();}&quot; to the class to get
</I>&gt;<i> things to work in the presence of the IJ1 jar that is included.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> I'm not well versed enough in maven or other such dependency management
