<PRE>Hi Joseph Collin,

&gt;<i> &gt; Almost correct. The file extensions accepted are dependent on the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This restrictions are not for dictatorship reasons, BTW, but to

</I>&gt;<i> Ok, that makes sense. I didn't mention lib/ because it isn't in a fresh

</I>
It is not used by default because we do not ship any platform-dependent
libraries by default. But it is added to the java.library.path (to be
precise, a platform-dependent subdirectory is added) so that it is
possible to ship platform-dependent libraries from update sites.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Am I correct? What I was attempting was to push a 1-2 bash script
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that was just &quot;ImageJ-linux64 --all-my-special-args...&quot; and having no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; extension or .sh didn't take.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Bash scripts cannot be executed by ImageJ, hence it does not make too

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; upload them into, say, lib/.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Couldn't you say the same thing about Fiji shipping with a .desktop
</I>&gt;<i> file?
</I>
It does not ship with a .desktop file. It generates it upon startup in
Linux. (To be precise, the ImageJ launcher does.)

&gt;<i> It's an analogous situation I think. We just want to make it easy to
</I>&gt;<i> launch Fiji in a certain way.
</I>
You are welcome to do that, bash scripts are not the way, however. A
better way would be to patch the ImageJ launcher to make it possible to
ship *limited* configuration via update sites that affects the way Fiji is
started.

So far, I am quite doubtful, however, that such a support is needed. I
might be wrong, but then, I have not been graced with the information
about the intended use case requiring those bash scripts.

Ciao,
Johannes
