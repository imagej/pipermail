<PRE>Hi everyone,

Over the past couple of days, the ImgLib developers have consolidated the
various branches of ImgLib2, and everything is now merged to master.

Because many people are still using ImgLib1, we decided to change the
ImgLib2 package prefix to net.imglib2, and leave the ImgLib1 code intact and
in place (with package prefix mpicbg.imglib). Thus, the master branch now
has two subtrees: imglib1 and imglib2. Because they have different package
prefixes and different Maven identifiers, it is now possible to import the
whole enchilada into your IDE of choice, or compile the entire thing from
the command line using Maven, without any conflicts or overlap. (You could
even write a program that used both ImgLib1 and ImgLib2 if you wish, though
we don't recommend it.)

We also simplified the project directory names. It now looks like this:

imglib.git
  -&gt; imglib1
    --&gt; algorithms
    --&gt; core
    --&gt; io
    etc.
  -&gt; imglib2
    --&gt; algorithms
    --&gt; core
    --&gt; io
    etc.

Because we are still finishing the migration to ImgLib2, only a subset of
the ImgLib2 projects currently compile. However, the top-level ImgLib2 Maven
POM includes only those projects that compile (imglib, imglib-io and
imglib-ui), with the others (e.g., imglib-algorithms) commented out until
they have been migrated. Hence, you should be able to compile the top-level
Maven project with no errors. The downside is that if you wish to import
non-compiling project into an IDE, you will need to explicitly select the
relevant project folder.

If all goes well, the ImageJDev Hudson (<A HREF="http://dev.imagejdev.org:8080/">http://dev.imagejdev.org:8080/</A>) will
build ImgLib-daily tonight as usual, and continue serving resources (e.g.,
Javadocs) with no interruption of service.

Remaining tasks include:
1) Update Fiji Fakefiles to reflect the new directory structure above.
2) Create POM for imglib2/examples subtree.
3) Fix PolygonRegionOfInterestTest's testRealRandomAccess and testSize
(currently commented out).
4) Unify test package prefixes (move the packageless ones, and those with
package prefix &quot;tests&quot;).

The ImageJDev team has already begun migrating the ImageJ2 codebase from
ImgLib1 to ImgLib2, and hopes to complete that work by the end of the week.

Thanks to Stephan Saalfeld, Tobias Pietzsch and Lee Kamentsky for their help
with the merge! Please let us know if you have any questions or problems
with it.

Regards,
Curtis
