<PRE>Funny you should ask - it's on my agenda to mention it at group  
meeting on Thursday.  It was announced at ISBI.  It seems like it's  
trying to be ImageJ with 5D support and nice organization for plugins,  
so in many ways it's redundant with the ImageJdev effort.  Will  
elaborate more on Thursday but am curious to hear others' take on it.
