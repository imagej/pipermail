<PRE>Hi everyone,

Today the ImageJDev team is releasing the fourth beta of ImageJ2, version
2.0.0-beta4.

ImageJ 2.0.0-beta4 is a &quot;beta&quot;-quality release, meaning the code is not
finished. The design is more stable than before but still subject to change
until the final 2.0.0 release. It is recommended that people continue to
use ImageJ v1.x for critical work.

The ImageJ2 user interface is modeled after ImageJ v1.x as much as
possible. However, under the hood, ImageJ2 is a complete redesign of
ImageJ. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ by
bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between &quot;legacy&quot; and &quot;modern&quot;
image structures.

Development of this release of ImageJ focused heavily on the plugin
architecture and various plugin implementations. There were also numerous
architecture changes to make ImageJ more flexible, powerful, and backwards
compatible. To accommodate this, changes were made to the plugin class
hierarchy, the user interface classes, the legacy layer, the updater, the
launcher, and in many other areas. There were also some improvements at the
application level&#8212;all in all, over 100 bugfixes and improvements.

For further details on this release, including a discussion of new
features, please see our blog post:
  <A HREF="http://developer.imagej.net/2012/09/11/imagej-v200-beta4">http://developer.imagej.net/2012/09/11/imagej-v200-beta4</A>

You can download the release from:
  <A HREF="http://developer.imagej.net/downloads">http://developer.imagej.net/downloads</A>

Please note that due to bugs in the Updater (which have since been fixed),
it is unfortunately not possible to update from a beta3 installation.
Please download the 2.0.0-beta4 distribution bundle instead.

The Downloads page also has a table of planned future releases and roadmap
links for the project. The focus of the next release (2.0.0-beta5) is on
better data visualization and processing.
