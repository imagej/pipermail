<PRE>Hi all,

after you guys have made so much progress during the hackathon, we felt 
motivated to review ourKNIME-ImageJ2 integration and try to further 
improve it, as we want to have everything set-up when you release 
ImageJ2 ;-)

Anyway, we discussed several things and a lot of questions came up 
concerning ImageJ2:

* The previewcheckbox in many dialogsis a bit problematic for us because 
(at the moment) we cannot support it
properly. We usethe ImageJ2 dialog building tools and thus always get a
preview checkbox if the plugin supports this. Would it be possible to 
add a flag that
surpresses previews checkboxes during dialog building?

* Why is the threshold plugin an interactive command? This for instance 
prevents the plugin from  beeing executing in headless mode (and hence 
from appearing as a KNIME node), which might be desirable in some use  
cases.

* Dynamic Commands: is there a way to determine if a command is dynamic?
   Currently wedo it via an instanceof-check which was commented with 
(probaby by Curtis):
           // SO UGLY! TODO: add API to ModuleInfo to query whether the 
module has
         // dynamically generated inputs and outputs (isStatic? isDynamic?)

* In KNIME we are currently loading all available plugins in the 
classpath which are headless executable. But therewith plugins like 
&quot;Help&quot;, &quot;Easteregg&quot;, &quot;LoadDataSet&quot; will appear as KNIME nodes as well. 
However they can't do anything useful in the KNIME context (as they are  
ImageJ2 specific). Are you planing to re-organize the plugins, e.g. such 
that plugins, which are interesting for any application reside in their 
own jar-file?

* Will the package path of the plugins be stable after ImageJ2 1.0.0 was 
released?

*Are there  plans how the &quot;dimension selection&quot; will be integrated into 
ImageJ2,  i.e. how algorithms can be run on arbitrary dimensions? 
(Mapping from  AxesNames to indicies of dimensions in images). Can we 
help here?(see Doc hackathon!?)

* ROIs: Are there plans to support Labelings in ImageJ2? Or will 
Labelings somehow be replaced in the future?
*In thecurrent snapshot (compared to beta6) some functionalitywas 
movedfrom  ImageJ to sifio / scijava (e.g. the Services). Regarding this 
some questions:
   - Is &quot;new ImageJ(services...)&quot; replaced by&quot;new Context(...services)&quot;?
- How can we query the ImageJ version? (previously ImageJ.VERSION)
   - the log level system property &quot;System.setProperty(&quot;ij.log.level&quot;, 
&quot;error&quot;);&quot;doesn't
seem to  work any more can you confirm this?
   -The services seem to have some  ordering requirements now, we had to 
move
ModuleService behind  MenuService in the constructor call to avoid a 
null pointer during
initialization (onEvent(ModulesAddedEvent) was called before 
initialize). Is there a defined
     service order?
((So far, we have tons of ideas where we could do more things together. 
Thank you in advance for answering all these questions ;)))

Cheers,

Martin, Christian and Michael Z.
