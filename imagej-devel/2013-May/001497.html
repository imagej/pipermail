<PRE>Hi Curtis,

I need to upload a new updater very soon now, but I fear that recent
changes in scijava-common require quite a lot of things to be uploaded. In
particular, the simulated complete-site upload says this:

-- snip --
$ app/ImageJ.app/ImageJ-linux64 --update upload-complete-site --simulate ImageJ
[... checksumming ...]
Done: Checksummer

Would upload new version of jars/jai_imageio-4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar
Warning: obsolete 'jars/lwf-stubs-4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar' still installed!
Would upload new version of jars/ij-io-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/ij-updater-core-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/ij-updater-ssh-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/ij-ui-common-awt-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/ome-xml-4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/ij-core-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/ij-ui-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/ij-legacy-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/ij-data-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/scifio-4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would mark jars/loci-common-4.4.9-SNAPSHOT.jar obsolete
Would upload new version of jars/ij-util-swing-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/imglib2-algorithms-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/imglib2-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/ij-ui-swing-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/ij-ui-swing-commands-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Warning: obsolete 'jars/loci-legacy-4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar' still installed!
Warning: obsolete 'jars/scifio-devel-4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar' still installed!
Warning: obsolete 'jars/turbojpeg-4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar' still installed!
Would upload new version of jars/scijava-common-1.4.0.jar
Would upload new version of jars/ij-commands-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Would upload new version of jars/ij-updater-webdav-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Use --force to ignore warnings and upload anyway
-- snap --

In particular, I am worried about these four lines:

Warning: obsolete 'jars/lwf-stubs-4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar' still installed!
Warning: obsolete 'jars/loci-legacy-4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar' still installed!
Warning: obsolete 'jars/scifio-devel-4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar' still installed!
Warning: obsolete 'jars/turbojpeg-4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar' still installed!

It appears to me that that would interfere with the careful downgrading of
Bio-Formats... what should I do?

Ciao,
Dscho

P.S.: I will now test whether the uploader still works if I copy over only
jars/*updater*.jar to Fiji; this would allow us to punt on Bio-Formats for
now and do a full upload later, at a more opportune time.

</PRE>
