<PRE>Hi everyone,

Today marks the beginning of the next biweekly development cycle (June
28-July 9).

To kick off each cycle, we would normally have a discussion at ~10:30am CST
on the applicable Monday. However, we missed last cycle (June 14-25) since I
was out of the office. And since Aivar and Brian are away today, we will
instead meet tomorrow to discuss goals for this cycle.

If you have open tickets, please update them with your progress, closing any
tickets that have been completed, and adding comments to describe any
progress. That way, the Trac preserves an accurate historical record of the
work we completed during each development cycle. Some time tomorrow I will
close the previous milestone, which will migrate all remaining open tickets
into the next milestone.

Grant, Adam &amp; Lee: We'll look for you guys on Skype tomorrow morning. Once
everyone involved is online, we can do a conference call to go over our
progress over the past two cycles, and goals for this next one.

-Curtis

&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As discussed during today's status report, I have configured biweekly
</I>&gt;<i> milestones through the end of the year on the ImageJ Trac. You can view them
</I>&gt;<i> at:
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://imagejdev.org/trac/imagej/roadmap">http://imagejdev.org/trac/imagej/roadmap</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please use these milestones as a todo list over the course of each two-week
</I>&gt;<i> interval. These milestones will serve as an organizational tool, quick
</I>&gt;<i> reference and declaration to the community of how we are directing our
</I>&gt;<i> individual efforts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Associated tickets (filed by logging in and clicking the &quot;new ticket&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> button on the top right) need not be complex&#8212;just one or two lines to remind
</I>&gt;<i> yourself of the task. When you can, try to break it down to actual &quot;next
</I>&gt;<i> physical action&quot; style tasks (see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zenhabits.net/why-whats-the-next-action-is-the-most-important-question/for">http://zenhabits.net/why-whats-the-next-action-is-the-most-important-question/for</A> a nice article about this), even if you list more than one &quot;next action&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> on the same ticket sometimes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cycles will begin on alternating Mondays (starting this Tuesday, June 1,
</I>&gt;<i> due to Memorial Day). On these Mondays, we will review our progress on the
</I>&gt;<i> previous cycle, troubleshoot any roadblocks with existing tickets, push
</I>&gt;<i> incomplete work into the next cycle, etc. On these Mondays, we can do this
</I>&gt;<i> instead of our usual &quot;stand-up&quot; meeting. Grant, it would be good if you
</I>&gt;<i> could join us for these biweekly reviews&#8212;we usually meet around 10:30am CST
</I>&gt;<i> (11:30am CST).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know if you have any questions about it!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Curtis
