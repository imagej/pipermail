It would be awesome if you could ask Philippe to open the sources.

&gt;<i> I have a problem with respect of committing the libraries. I use the

</I>
I do not know much about the EGit plugin (I always use command-line Git,
which comes more naturally to me given that I co-developed it), but my
guess is that it does not allow you to add the lib folder because Maven
wants versioned artifacts instead.

In any case, for re-usability and to prevent re-inventing the wheel, I
would much prefer to have the sources anyway ;-)

Thanks,
Johannes
