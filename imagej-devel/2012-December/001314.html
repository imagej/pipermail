<PRE>Hi Barry &amp; Curtis,

with great satisfaction I report that the Legacy Mode branch has reached a
beta stage. That is, I consider this functionality to be at a stage where
we can include it in a beta version.

Sadly, I did not manage to think of a way to test this functionality
automatically yet, mainly because most of it is purely in the GUI: images
shown in IJ2 will be hidden and the IJ1 ImageWindows displayed when
switching to the legacy mode, and vice versa when switching back.

It is all in the 'legacy' branch, and I would appreciate a good look-over
by both of you.

The menu item it adds is in Help&gt;Start ImageJ 1.x Legacy Mode, and when
you switch to that mode, you will get a Help&gt;Stop ImageJ 1.x Legacy Mode
in the ImageJ 1.x GUI.

There is one commit that is reverted right away, this is the change I
intended originally to make it possible to have multiple legacy services
running in parallel. Alas, it interferes with normal operation; you would
not be able to instantiate an ImagePlus and pass it to the legacy service,
since your class loader and the legacy service's class loader would have
incompatible versions of the ImagePlus *class*. The reason why I left it
in was for education and to remember what did not work, so that I would
keep thinking of better ways.

Once that legacy mode is in, and robust, I plan to integrate it into Fiji
by adding the &quot;Stop Legacy Mode&quot; as a Help&gt;Try ImageJ2 or some such.

Ciao &amp; merry Christmas,
Dscho

</PRE>
