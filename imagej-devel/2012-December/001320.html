I did work on that. The only problem I had during testing was that at some
stage, the x and y axes would not be found, so the PixelProbe threw
exceptions abound. After a while, that was fixed, though. Probably some
performance issue preventing things from being harmonized quickly enough.

BTW I just saw that Jenkins is not happy, it thinks that legacy tests are
failing. But when I ran mvn locally (&quot;mvn clean test&quot;), things worked!

&gt;<i> &gt; I took a look at adding some sort of legacyService.sync() call, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the LegacyService API still needs work. Currently there is a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; logic taking place in LegacyCommand.LegacyCommandThread.run(), which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should ultimately get factored out to be more accessible from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; LegacyService itself. But that work will have to wait until after the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; holidays.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agree!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So anyway, we will note this limitation in the release announcement,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another problem which I would like to see fixed before release is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on OS X, when starting up ImageJ2 now, there is a VerifyError with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; class MacAdapter that was not previously present. I hope to track this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; down tomorrow morning and fix before cutting the release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I know what it is. Left over from some previous iteration.
</I>
Yep, it was that issue: I added special handling for &quot;$service&quot; in the
CodeHacker so that I could easily change the method how the LegacyService
is discovered for use in the javassisted functions, but I forgot one.

FWIW I pushed my stuff to the 'legacy' branch, but the commits were
designed to be patched into the branch ;-) I'll work a bit more on the
commit messages.

For the moment, I will have to refrain from working on the Jenkins issue
and from trying to resolve my ImgLib issues because my internet connection
is too slow... :-(

Ciao,
Dscho
