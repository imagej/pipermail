<PRE>Hi Curtis,

Good point, I forgot to test that.

It is probably some addition to LegacyImageMap#toggleLegacyMode(boolean)
to make sure all known ImagePlus instances are shown.

Will have a look during the flight.

&gt;<i> I took a look at adding some sort of legacyService.sync() call, but the
</I>&gt;<i> LegacyService API still needs work. Currently there is a lot of logic
</I>&gt;<i> taking place in LegacyCommand.LegacyCommandThread.run(), which should

</I>
Agree!

&gt;<i> So anyway, we will note this limitation in the release announcement, for
</I>&gt;<i> now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another problem which I would like to see fixed before release is that
</I>&gt;<i> on OS X, when starting up ImageJ2 now, there is a VerifyError with class
</I>&gt;<i> MacAdapter that was not previously present. I hope to track this down
</I>&gt;<i> tomorrow morning and fix before cutting the release.
</I>
I think I know what it is. Left over from some previous iteration.

See you on the other side!
