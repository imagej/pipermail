<PRE>Hi everyone,

The ImageJDev team has released the sixth beta of ImageJ2, version 2.0.0-
beta6.

ImageJ 2.0.0-beta6 is a &quot;beta&quot;-quality release, meaning the code is not
finished. The design is more stable than before but still subject to change
until the final 2.0.0 release. It is recommended that people continue to
use ImageJ v1.x for critical work.

The ImageJ2 user interface is modeled after ImageJ v1.x as much as
possible. However, under the hood, ImageJ2 is a complete redesign of
ImageJ. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ by
bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between &quot;legacy&quot; and &quot;modern&quot;
image structures.

Development of this release of ImageJ focused on improved legacy support.
In particular, ImageJ2 now allows you to switch to a dedicated &quot;legacy
mode&quot; for maximum compatibility with ImageJ1.

For further details on this release, including a discussion of new
features, please see our blog post:
  <A HREF="http://developer.imagej.net/2012/12/27/imagej-v200-beta6">http://developer.imagej.net/2012/12/27/imagej-v200-beta6</A>

You can download the release from:
  <A HREF="http://developer.imagej.net/downloads">http://developer.imagej.net/downloads</A>

To more accurately reflect what is left to do, we have again reestimated
ImageJ2's release dates, and scheduled additional betas before the final 2.0
.0 release. See the Downloads page for the updated table of planned future
releases and roadmap links for the project. The focus of the next release (
2.0.0-beta7) is on robust core support for N-dimensional data, including
very large image data, and data/display decoupling.

For more details on the ImageJ developments, see the web site at:
  <A HREF="http://developer.imagej.net/">http://developer.imagej.net/</A>

Lastly, please note most of the ImageJ development team will be away for
the next 1-2 weeks, back in early January. So we may be a bit slow
responding to mails until then.

Regards and happy holidays,
