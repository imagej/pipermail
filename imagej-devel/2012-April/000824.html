<PRE>Hi everyone,

Today, the ImageJDev team is proud to release the first beta of ImageJ2,
version 2.0.0-beta1!

ImageJ 2.0.0-beta1 is a &quot;beta&quot;-quality release, meaning the code is not
finished. The design is more stable than before but still subject to change
until the final 2.0.0 release. It is recommended that people continue to
use ImageJ v1.x for critical work.

The ImageJ2 user interface is modeled after ImageJ v1.x as much as
possible. However, under the hood, ImageJ2 is a complete redesign of
ImageJ. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ by
bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between &quot;legacy&quot; and &quot;modern&quot;
image structures.

The beta still has many bugs and limitations, but we have achieved several
substantial milestones:

   - Support for most ImageJ1 plugins and macros
   - Many new pixel types (thanks to ImgLib2)
   - Multidimensional data beyond 5D (thanks to ImgLib2)
   - Import and export of all SCIFIO-supported file formats
   - Improved region of interest (ROI) tools
   - Truly headless: image processing is separate from user interface
   - Automatic updates: once you download beta1, ImageJ can update itself
   - Easily install additional plugins, including Fiji (over 350 plugins!)
   - 175 new and/or reimplemented core ImageJ2 plugins so far
   - 125+ bugs fixed


Many legacy ImageJ plugins and macros work; many others do not. There are
still many bugs. In particular, there are a few issues specifically
regarding 2.0.0-beta1:

   - On Windows &amp; Linux, you must have Java already installed; ImageJ2 is
   not bundled with Java, nor will it download it for you.
   - On Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, there is a bug that prevents ImageJ2 from
   launching successfully. This bug will be fixed in the next beta release,
   and is already fixed in the development version.
   - On Windows, when ImageJ2 first starts, a console message (&quot;Falling
   back to system Java&quot;) appears, which is merely informative and is safe to
   ignore. This message will no longer be displayed in the next beta release,
   and is already fixed in the development version.


For further details on this release, including a discussion of new
features, please see our blog post:
