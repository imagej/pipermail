<PRE>Hi Jay,


Anyway, not sure if IJ2 is the place for this kind of development, but it
&gt;<i> is an intriguing possibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think IJ2 is the perfect opportunity for the types of functionality you
describe. We just haven't had time to add it yet. Like I said, we want to
have a plotting API whose data structures are not tied to any particular
user interface. We have a general-purpose Display framework for this
already, and work continues to improve it for beta2. Adding the plotting
structures is a matter of defining a few new classes for it, and
implementing the Swing-specific UI frontend that responds to display events
when they are broadcast.

If you have some time and would like to get involved in the development,
let me know, and perhaps we could have a Skype chat about it. Otherwise, we
will have more for you to try by beta2 or beta3.

Regards,
Curtis
