In my opinion, ImageJ2 is exactly the best place to put your work into.
Because of the separation between data and UI, you will have less trouble
with backwards-compatibility. We also tried to follow the plugin pattern
where you can add different consumers; in this particular case, one could
come up with a Plot window that is written in pure AWT (like IJ1's) but
one could also use a Plot window that attaches to your Spreadsheet program
and uses that for displaying the Plot. This is possible simply because the
UI cannot affect the way the data are stored.

Of course, this flexibility comes at the price that we had to flesh out
quite a few issues &quot;under the hood&quot;. So we did not come to work on
histograms and plot windows quite yet. But we will, hopefully with your
help!

Ciao,
Dscho
