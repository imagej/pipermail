<PRE>Hi Curtis,

Thanks a lot for the explanations. That was really helpful.

I thought it was all somehow caused by targeting java 1.5.
I did not know that Fiji used the 49.0 class version anyway.
So I'm much more comfortable with that now. I will still run
the benchmark to compare the class versions, just to know for
sure.

best regards,
Tobias

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I am sorry I could not send a mail explaining the situation
</I>&gt;<i> earlier, but we were fully occupied just fixing all the build problems
</I>&gt;<i> that had accumulated over the past few days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your confusion is understandable, because there were several unrelated
</I>&gt;<i> issues that required solving.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *== 1) TrakEM2 precompiled was out of date ==
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the least significant problem was that building Fiji without
</I>&gt;<i> having modules/TrakEM2 initialized caused compile errors, due to the
</I>&gt;<i> precompiled TrakEM2 jar not matching the rest of the codebase. Fixing
</I>&gt;<i> this required rebuilding TrakEM2 from source and committing the new jar
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/34ae3188">https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/34ae3188</A>). Doing so was complicated
</I>&gt;<i> only by the fact that the Fiji build system needed a little TLC first
</I>&gt;<i> (see #2 next).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *== 2) Bugs in the Fiji build system and ImageJ launcher ==
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> Johannes has been working very hard on the ImageJ launcher, in
</I>&gt;<i> preparation for inclusion with ImageJ2. Initially, much of that work was
</I>&gt;<i> done in fiji.git on ImageJ.c. The code has been steadily improving, but
</I>&gt;<i> as with all such changes, new bugs can be introduced or brought to light
</I>&gt;<i> as a result:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A) Dscho &amp; I tracked down a bug with the launcher on OS X, noticed by
</I>&gt;<i> Steffi: <A HREF="https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/a7d90f38">https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/a7d90f38</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> B) Dscho fixed another bug specific to OS X:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/25e58077">https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/25e58077</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> C) Steffi fixed a problem with Fiji build on Windows:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/a85acab1">https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/a85acab1</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once those problems were fixed, we were able to finish solving the
</I>&gt;<i> tougher issues, below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *== 3) The OpenJDK6 Javac bug ==
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> The OpenJDK6 problem has nothing to do with Java5. There are several
</I>&gt;<i> usages of generics in ImgLib that Fiji's OpenJDK6 compiler failed to
</I>&gt;<i> handle properly. To resolve it, Johannes upgraded Fiji's version of
</I>&gt;<i> OpenJDK6 to the latest available
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/402dce11">https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/402dce11</A>). However, this latest
</I>&gt;<i> version introduced some new problems when compiling SPIM registration,
</I>&gt;<i> so Johannes partially reverted it
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/82bd2950">https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/82bd2950</A>). But still a few bugs
</I>&gt;<i> remained when compiling ImgLib. To work around them, I introduced the
</I>&gt;<i> ugly &quot;HACK&quot; changes (<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imglib/commit/5748a1be">https://github.com/imagej/imglib/commit/5748a1be</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know these HACKs are unpleasant, but the fact is that we are targeting
</I>&gt;<i> three different compilers: Oracle's Java6, OpenJDK6, and Eclipse's JDT
</I>&gt;<i> compiler. If ImgLib fails to compile with any of them, then our current
</I>&gt;<i> workflows have problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the future, as OpenJDK7 becomes the gold standard for compilation,
</I>&gt;<i> and Java7 is more easily available for all major platforms, the
</I>&gt;<i> dichotomy between compilation with Fiji build (which uses OpenJDK6) and
</I>&gt;<i> Maven on the command line (which uses your installed Java, often
</I>&gt;<i> Oracle's Java6, depending on your platform) should disappear. We will
</I>&gt;<i> likely need to remain cautious indefinitely with respect to Eclipse's
</I>&gt;<i> JDT compiler, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Is there anything I have to be careful about now, so that I don't
</I>&gt;<i>     break anything?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As always, just because something works in Eclipse does not mean it will
</I>&gt;<i> work with Oracle's Java6, or with OpenJDK6. In a perfect world, we would
</I>&gt;<i> all test our changes with all three compilers (on all three OSes too!),
</I>&gt;<i> but personally I think asking everyone to always do that is unrealistic.
</I>&gt;<i> That's what Jenkins is for. Just don't be surprised if sometimes the
</I>&gt;<i> build breaks even though Eclipse had no problems. And if you see that
</I>&gt;<i> one of your changes broke the build, it is extremely helpful if you can
</I>&gt;<i> find a fix/workaround, rather than waiting for Dscho or me to fix it.
</I>&gt;<i> J-Y asked in another thread (&quot;Fiji does not compile anymore under Mac
</I>&gt;<i> and Windows&quot;) about the best way to test compilation in Fiji build,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.&#8212;on Monday I will reply there with more details, and create a new
</I>&gt;<i> page on the Fiji wiki about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a side note, it can happen the other way too: yesterday Johannes
</I>&gt;<i> merged the ImageJ launcher to ImageJ2, and it is all working fine from
</I>&gt;<i> the command line, but not from Eclipse. ;-) The reality is that it takes
</I>&gt;<i> work to keep everything running smoothly across the different paradigms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *== 4) The Java5 compatibility snafu ==
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> Recently, I asked whether we should migrate the imglib2-io project into
</I>&gt;<i> SCIFIO (a.k.a. Bio-Formats), and people responded favorably. So Mark
</I>&gt;<i> Hiner &amp; I did it on a topic branch, and when Melissa Linkert visited
</I>&gt;<i> last week, we merged the changes
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/pull/39,">https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/pull/39,</A> ). However, we
</I>&gt;<i> forgot one important detail: SCIFIO still uses a Java5 compiler to
</I>&gt;<i> build. (Actually, the entire OME software stack does.) So the OME
</I>&gt;<i> Jenkins failed to build SCIFIO with the new ImgLib I/O classes, and we
</I>&gt;<i> scrambled to find a solution. We created a temporary Java5 version of
</I>&gt;<i> imglib2.jar that we could use, and fixed a couple of other oversights
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/pull/45">https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/pull/45</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That fixed the build problems, but Dscho &amp; I wanted to find a more
</I>&gt;<i> permanent solution to the build compatibility problem between SCIFIO and
</I>&gt;<i> ImgLib2. I had an idea for a compromise&#8212;target Java 1.5 for the core
</I>&gt;<i> imglib2 project&#8212;which I implemented on Thursday
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imglib/commit/c66f26e6">https://github.com/imagej/imglib/commit/c66f26e6</A>). I did not know that
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse would misbehave when importing the project until afterwards&#8212;but
</I>&gt;<i> that problem is now fixed (see below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an aside, I would like to point out that compiling ImgLib to target
</I>&gt;<i> Java5 is nothing new. Fiji build has done this from the beginning, and
</I>&gt;<i> not just for imglib2 core, but for *all* of ImgLib
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/702c921b">https://github.com/fiji/fiji/commit/702c921b</A>). You'll notice the line
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;javaVersion=1.5&quot; which tells Fiji build to compile the code to class
</I>&gt;<i> version 49.0 (Java 1.5). So those of you building ImgLib via Fiji build
</I>&gt;<i> are already using class version 49.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Are there plans to figure out the performance implications of using
</I>&gt;<i>     the old class format?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Dscho says, we have no plans to test it ourselves. However, it would
</I>&gt;<i> be very easy to run the ImgLib2 benchmarks
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imglib/blob/master/imglib2/ij/src/test/scripts/benchmark.sh">https://github.com/imagej/imglib/blob/master/imglib2/ij/src/test/scripts/benchmark.sh</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> with a Java5 jar vs. a Java6 one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have absolutely no idea if performance is impacted by using a
</I>&gt;<i> Java5-compatible jar. Personally, I doubt it. However, Johannes
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned offhand that it might be a possibility, and I agreed, so I
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned it in the commit message. But it is pure speculation. ImgLib
</I>&gt;<i> has proven to be extremely sensitive to small changes (because the JIT
</I>&gt;<i> is sensitive), so we thought it worth mentioning. But I did not mean to
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that such performance problems were necessarily likely&#8212;merely
</I>&gt;<i> conceivable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Can I (locally) just remove the maven-compiler-plugin section from
</I>&gt;<i>     the pom and have everything working as before?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question is now moot, because in a commit earlier today, I disabled
</I>&gt;<i> the Java5 targeting by default
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/imglib/commit/b67f246f">https://github.com/imagej/imglib/commit/b67f246f</A>). It must now be
</I>&gt;<i> enabled explicitly using a profile. Things should now work in Eclipse
</I>&gt;<i> again, exactly as before. Jenkins now turns on the Java5 targeting when
</I>&gt;<i> it builds, so that the imglib2.jar deployed to the Maven repository
</I>&gt;<i> (which SCIFIO builds against) will remain Java5 compatible. But those of
</I>&gt;<i> us using Eclipse will not suffer any inconvenience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding making local changes to a POM: in general I would discourage
</I>&gt;<i> it. If you find yourself needing to do so, we should discuss what
</I>&gt;<i> problem you are trying to solve, and what an easier and more effective
</I>&gt;<i> solution might be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *== 5) Continuing changes to ImgLib2 I/O classes ==
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> We have been testing ImageJ2's I/O plugins, which use the ImgLib2
</I>&gt;<i> ImgOpener and ImgSaver classes. The ImgSaver in particular is very new,
</I>&gt;<i> and still under active development. Unfortunately, the turnaround time
</I>&gt;<i> to merge changes into SCIFIO, and make them available from ImageJ's
</I>&gt;<i> Maven repository, is days to weeks. So while there is another pull
</I>&gt;<i> request pending to update the ImgLib I/O code in SCIFIO
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/pull/49">https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/pull/49</A>), for the
</I>&gt;<i> impending ImageJ2 beta we needed a solution more rapidly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what we did is to commit the latest version back to the imglib2-io
</I>&gt;<i> project of imglib.git as well. Now, the code lives in both projects,
</I>&gt;<i> with two different package names (net.imglib2.io
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://net.imglib2.io">http://net.imglib2.io</A>&gt;, and ome.scifio.img). At the moment, the code is
</I>&gt;<i> in sync. The long term plan is still to remove the imglib2-io project in
</I>&gt;<i> favor of it being part of SCIFIO, but it will have to wait until we can
</I>&gt;<i> achieve the speed of integrated multi-project development we are
</I>&gt;<i> accustomed to with Fiji. The good news is that there is now a working
</I>&gt;<i> ImgSaver available for use (feedback welcome!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully this clarifies the recent changes to Fiji and ImgLib. Please
</I>&gt;<i> let us know if anything else is unclear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
