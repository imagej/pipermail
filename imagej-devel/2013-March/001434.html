<PRE>Hi,

More progress.

Switching on file mapping brought it down to 1,115ms:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/dscho/TifBenchmark/commit/1ac041e8f4ce5d935151fcfb70023f67f2a086df">https://github.com/dscho/TifBenchmark/commit/1ac041e8f4ce5d935151fcfb70023f67f2a086df</A>

A minor improvement to 1,097ms was achieved by switching the ImageReader
from using the Location delegator to using the real thing instead:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/bioformats/commit/2bbf001061d13882234d07cdbd8cdcbfb9778675">https://github.com/imagej/bioformats/commit/2bbf001061d13882234d07cdbd8cdcbfb9778675</A>

Switching the ZeissTIFFReader (which tries very hard to claim that it is
responsible to open the files) from using a delegator to the real
CaseInsensitiveLocation brought it down to 957ms:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/bioformats/commit/ce94a9e8647a2f786bba3045b005ec0973df5e83">https://github.com/imagej/bioformats/commit/ce94a9e8647a2f786bba3045b005ec0973df5e83</A>

A real game changer was to disallow the ZeissTIFFReader to blow away the
cache of the CaseInsensitiveLocation class *every* *single* *time*,
bringing the time down to 317ms:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/imagej/bioformats/commit/33447f50a51356cdc0609164002f0860c724d5e9">https://github.com/imagej/bioformats/commit/33447f50a51356cdc0609164002f0860c724d5e9</A>

My hunch is that there is serious room for improvement in the
CaseInsensitiveLocation class. And probably even in the ZeissTIFFReader:
there must be a nicer way to detect whether we are dealing with a Zeiss
.tiff than to look at all files in the same directory, searching for files
with a similar name -- and maybe even differ in capitalization, thanks
Zeiss :-(.

I could even imagine that with .tiff being such a common case with such a
lot of subtypes that it will be *necessary* to add an own class of plugins
for TIFF subtypes, so that the base TIFF reader can be chosen quickly as
the one to use, without having to run through the complete list of readers
when determining what is the correct reader. The subtype plugins would
then have to implement a very fast test *after* we already know that it is
a TIFF. Some of them could then even state that scanning through all the
IFDs is not necessary (e.g. when it is detected that ImageJ 1.x wrote the
file.).

And finally, the profiling pointed out that I was right when I had a bad
feeling about the #isThisType() method and wanted something less
free-form, such as a combination of file extensions and patterns to match
against the first kilobyte (much like the HandleExtraFileTypes class does
it). Worse: the signature of isThisType() does not even allow sharing of a
RandomAccessInputStream! And sure enough, a dominant part of the
performance statistics are made up by opening gazillions of
RandomAccessInputStreams, all for the exact same file, all reading pretty
much the exact same bytes. Setting setAllowOpen(false) -- whose name I
mistook as first to imply that we refuse to open files at all, hence
preventing us from opening images altogether -- brings the time down to
186ms:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/dscho/TifBenchmark/commit/d10db689c36b668bb190b041f0582add33ef1990">https://github.com/dscho/TifBenchmark/commit/d10db689c36b668bb190b041f0582add33ef1990</A>

Summary so far: the target is to come close to 115ms [*1*]. I started out
with code that took a whopping 4,922ms. With a couple of tricks and
shortcuts, I got it down to 186ms, not quite the 43x improvement I hoped
for, but a 26x improvement still [*2*].

Ciao,
Dscho

P.S.: One thing I almost forgot to mention: initializing the logger takes
quite some time. It is a one-time cost, sure, but it is quite noticable
when the first slice is opened (hence I excluded the first run from the
performance profiling for now). We might want to do something about that,
e.g. constructing a super-light-weight logger a la scijava-common's
StderrLogService by default.

Footnote *1*: ImageJ 1.x' new ImagePlus(path) wrapped as a float Img). We
will probably not be able to reach that goal because the ImgOpener is
intended to handle many more file formats than just TIFF, and it should
also open images which are valid as far as the TIFF specification is
concerned but which ImageJ 1.x completely fails on.

Footnote *2*: The changes to SCIFIO, ImgOpener and to TifBenchmark are not
ready yet for prime time, unfortunately. For example, I doubt that it will
be a good idea to force people to use PlanarContainers all the time. We
need to accelerate ImgOpener with ArrayContainers because they will be the
common case (much better performance than PlanarContainers, but too
limited for truly large images). We need to teach SCIFIO to determine in a
more intelligent way when file grouping does not make sense at all, and to
switch it off in that case. The CaseInsensitiveLocation needs a *lot* of
improvement, I haven't even touched it yet. We also need to teach SCIFIO
to stop being stubborn and re-use the RandomAccessInputStream when it
comes to the readers to determine whether they want to handle the image.
Maybe that is not enough, even, and we have to re-design the complete
strategy how readers are picked. One thing is utterly clear, though: in
its current form, the ImgOpener is not fit for daily use.
