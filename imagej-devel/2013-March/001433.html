<PRE>Hi Tobias,

I finally have some promising results to show. After writing a
light-weight profile based on the ideas of OProfile, but backed by
Javassist (hence it neither requires operating system support nor a
special Java agent or other start-up parameters to the Java virtual
machine), I could find a couple of bottlenecks, even if it seems that the
most important bottleneck I found was obtaining thread-specific CPU tick
counts (i.e. the profiling code itself that I subsequently replaced by
global ticks, not as precise, but way lower impact).

I performed all timings as best of 5 runs (which is a more meaningful
value than the Median), 50 tif images, 10,000 other tif files in same
directory. My current state can be found in the 'master' branch of
<A HREF="git://github.com/dscho/TifBenchmark.">git://github.com/dscho/TifBenchmark.</A>

The most surprising finding was that copying from planes into the
ArrayContainer contributed substantially to the execution time. Using a
PlanarContainer speeded that up.

Another speed-up (and nice simplification of the code) was to use
ByteBuffer instead of hand-coded byte array to float array. After
switching off profiling, it turned out not to be that much of an
improvement, though it does shave off about 200 milliseconds; given that
the reference we try to reach is only ~120ms it might be an important
improvement, still.

You can find this change (not yet cleaned up) in the 'performance' branch
of <A HREF="git://github.com/imagej/bioformats.">git://github.com/imagej/bioformats.</A> I will work more on this branch.

Together with setGroupFiles(false), I achieved a dramatic speed-up. The
time is now dominated by createReader which initializes the Reader for
every slice, which in turn creates a new OMEXMLMetadata (taking a whopping
17 milliseconds every single time).

This change is in the 'performance' branch of
<A HREF="git://github.com/imagej/imglib.">git://github.com/imagej/imglib.</A> I will work more also on this branch.

ArrayContainer (i.e. Tobias' original benchmark):	best of 5: 4,922 ms
ByteBuffer, ArrayContainer:				best of 5: 4,838 ms
PlanarContainer:					best of 5: 4,736 ms
ByteBuffer, PlanarContainer:				best of 5: 4,540 ms
PlanarContainer, setGroupFiles(true):			best of 5: 1,832 ms
ByteBuffer, PlanarContainer, setGroupFiles(true):	best of 5: 1,629 ms
ImageJ 1.x:						best of 5: 113 ms

Down from a 44x slower code to 14x slower. Still nothing to laugh about,
but an improvement.

Ciao,
Johannes

P.S.: just to illustrate the impact on execution time by the profiling
code itself: the ImageJ 1.x test runs 2ms longer (115ms instead of 113ms),
the best ImgOpener runs 3,523ms instead of 1,629ms, more than double as
long! Even when instrumenting the code but switching off the profiling
(i.e. every method still has to test one public static boolean and then a
local variable just before returning), the time was still 1,839ms, i.e.
200ms slower. If you switch on thread-specific tick counting via the
ThreadMXBean, ImageJ 1.x goes up to 568ms, and the best ImgOpener
benchmark goes up to more than 100 seconds(!).
