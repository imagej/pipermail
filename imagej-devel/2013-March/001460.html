<PRE>Hi Johannes,

thanks for clarifying and for your hard work to getting back into
operation.  It's been relieving for me to see that the data is
accessible and in place, probably saving many of us from painfully
collecting distributed bits and pieces.

I don't remember to having said anything extraordinarily kind (probably
one of your jokes---huh?).  But here it is:

Thanks a lot to you, Curtis and Matt for the hard work to getting
fiji.sc back.

Cheers,
Stephan

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for working on it and for any information on the matter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are welcome. And as I said, thank you so much for the kind words.
